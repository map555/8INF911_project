NO ONE:
DEADASS NO ONE:
SELF DEPRESSED WHITE GIRLS:

YOUR WANTING TO SING BUT CAN‚ÄôT DO IT WITHOUT OTHER PEOPLE
ME: I‚ÄôM GOING TO GET LAUGHED AT BY MY FAMILYüò£

IS IT ME OR AM I
THE ONLY PERSON WHO WANTS TO BACK TO SCHOOL AFTER ONE WEEK OF BEING QUARANTINED

KEEPS TRYING TO PINCH AND OPEN
REGULAR PRINTED PHOTOS TO ZOOM IN!

WHEN UR BIRTHDAY IS DURING QUARANTINE
AND U LIVE BY YOURSELF AND U HAVE NO ONE NO CELEBRATE IT WITH

WHEN TILTED GETS BLOWN UP
FORTNITE COMMUNITY BE LIKE:

ALL THE CELEBRITIES ARE GETTING CORONAVIRUS‚Ä¶
I WANNA GET IT, TOO!!!

WHEN YOUR SYRUP
TOUCHES YOUR EGGS

THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT
SPORTS ARE CANCELED DUE TO CORONAVIRUS

I SPENT 10 MINUTES LOOKING FOR MY PHONE IN MY CAR
WHILE USING MY PHONE AS THE FLASHLIGHT

MY KIDS ARE A DISAPPOINTMENT
AND IV'E RAN OUT OF TOILET PAPER

WHEN YOU HAVE
ENOUGH TOILET PAPER
BUT NOT ENOUGH REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER EGGS

WAS TRAVELING AND GOT STUCK IN QUARANTINE
NOW TRAPPED AT A BEACH RESORT FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS

MY FACE MASK AND LATEX GLOVES
ARE UNCOMFORTABLE TO SHOP IN

WHEN YOU FINALLY GET COMFY IN YOUR SEAT AND REALIZE
THAT YOU LEFT YOUR DRINK ON THE COUNTER

I ASKED MY HUSBAND WHY HE CARRIED A GUN AROUND THE HOUSE AND HE SAID ‚ÄúFEAR OF THE CIA‚Äù
I LAUGHED, HE LAUGHED, ALEXA LAUGHED . . .

My last day on Imgflip
as #32 before Kewlew passes me by

I JUST LEARNED THAT MY LIFE COACH
HAS BENCHED ME.

I FOUND MY SON LISTENING TO
JUSTIN BIEBER

I GOT SO MAD AT SOMEONE TODAY, I SCREAMED OUT
I HOPE SOMEONE STEALS ALL YOUR TOILET PAPER

MAKES THE FUNNIEST MEME EVER
EVERYBODY ON IMGFLIP TOO SICK FROM CORONA TO UPVOTE IT

ME WHEN
I REALICE THE WEKEND IS OVER

I SWITCHED MY 401K TO TOILET PAPER STOCKS
NOW I'M TOO RICH TO GET A STIMULUS CHECK

NOW THAT I‚ÄôM STOCKED UP WITH ENOUGH FOOD TO SURVIVE A CRISIS
I CAN‚ÄôT FIND ANYTHING IN THE REFRIGERATOR

WHEN YOU STOCK UP ON HUNDREDS OF ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER
AND AMAZON WON‚ÄôT LET YOU SELL IT

PLACES A GLASS BLOCK WRONG IN MINECRAFT
DOESN'T HAVE A SILK TOUCH TOOL

MY RESUME IS REALLY JUST A LONG LIST OF THINGS
THAT I NEVER WANT TO DO AGAIN.

YOU SPILL COFFEE ON YOUR PANTS
THAT YOU PLANNED TO WEAR FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK

NO REGIONAL CONVENTIONS WORLDWIDE
I‚ÄôM GONNA BE SINGLE FOREVER

WHEN YOU MAKE REALLY GOOD MEMES
AND THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE IT TO 1000 VIEWS

I DON'T MAKE
GOOD MEMES ANYMORE

IN-SEARCH SHOPPING ADS
ON YOUTUBE

YOUR MOM
WHEN HER CRACK DEALER IS SOCIAL DISTANCING

WHEN I CHEATED ON HIM 7 TIMES
AND I SAW HIM TAKING A PICTURE WITH AN OTHER GIRL

PLEASE SPARE ME THE AGONY OF LISTENING TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS
IF YOU ALWAYS END UP WITH THE SAME IDIOT.

WHEN I SEE A MEME DESPERATE FOR UP VOTES
WHY CANT I JUST FIND A GOOD MEME

IS SHE TALKING
WITH YOUR EXBOYFRIEND?

WHEN YOU PARK YOUR CAR
THEN A GOOD SONG COMES ON

NEW LAW PROHIBITS TEXTING WHILE DRIVING
NOW I GOTTA GET A CELL PHONE JUST TO PARTICIPATE IN NOT TEXTING

WHEN YOUR MOM TELLS YOU
NO ICE CREAM FOR DINNER

HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A 2 POUND BOX OF CHOCOLATES
TO MAKE YOU 5 POUNDS HEAVIER?

I WANTED MY BABY TO SAY MA-MA
BUT HE SAID POO-POO

WHEN YOU REALIZE WHAT THE
REAL MEANING IS

THEY STOPPED PLAYING
CHRISTMAS MUSIC ON THE RADIO

I WISH THAT PEOPLE WERE LIKE INTERNET VIDEOS AND THAT YOU COULD TAP THEM LIGHTLY TO SEE A CLOCK
OF HOW MUCH LONGER THEY'RE GOING TO BE TALKING.

I WANNA LIKE PEOPLE
BUT THEY ARE TOO IGNORNANT/STUPID FOR ME

SOMETIMES I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW TO SPELL A WORD
SO I CHANGE THE WHOLE SENTENCE TO AVOID USING IT.

CORONAVIRUS HAS DISRUPTED MY NORMAL CAVIAR DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL
LOCAL GROCERY STORE THAT IS STILL OPEN ONLY CARRIES BLACK CAPEL IN CAVIAR

Christmas is just like my day job
I do all the work and some fat guy in a suit takes all the credit

WHEN YOU HAD A GREAT SUNDAY NIGHT
THEN YOU REALISE THAT IT'S MONDAY

WHEN YOU REALIZE MINECRAFT
WILL HAVE ITS LAST UPDATE ONE DAY

APPARENTLY, MY SUPERPOWER IS THE ABILITY TO ALWAYS CHOOSE
THE SLOWEST MOVING CHECKOUT LINE IN ANY STORE.

The Wal-Mart greeter wouldn't
let me leave until I showed him my receipt

I MEANT TO BUY A NEW HOME THEATER SYSTEM FOR $350.00 WITH MY CREDIT CARD POINTS
STILL WOUND UP SPENDING $1,000.00

WHEN GIRLS
CAN'T CHECK INSTAGRAM

WHEN YOU FIND A SITE THAT IS NOT BLOKED AT YOUR SCHOOL
BUT THEN THEY BLOCK IT

IT'S SO COLD THAT I POURED CORN FLAKES INTO MY BOWL
BUT BY THE TIME I STARTED EATING THEM, THEY WERE FROSTED.

THE CASHIER JUST HELD MY 5 DOLLAR BILL UP TO THE LIGHT
DO I REALLY LOOK THAT BAD?

I SAW A REALLY DUMB COMMENT AND DOWNVOTED IT
BUT IMGFLIP TOLD ME I'M SILLY FOR VOTING ON MY OWN COMMENT

ME WHEN
PEWDIEPIE IS NOT POSTING VIDEO

TO WHOEVER STOLE MY ANTIDEPRESSANT PILLS:
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY

WHEN YOU FIND OUT UR DICKS
BIGGER THE AVERAGE
BUT YOU MEASURED IN MM

AFTER STOCK MARKET CRASH
The condition of "Speculators"

I'M NEVER GOING TO BE POPULAR ENOUGH
TO HAVE MY OWN "MEME WEEK"

IRONIC THAT MY KIDS CAN'T REMEMBER TO SAY THE "PLEASE" WORD
BUT BOY DO THEY REMEMBER THE WORD I USED THAT ONE TIME IN HEAVY TRAFFIC LAST YEAR

WHEN YOU'VE LOST THE WILL TO LIVE
BUT YOU STILL HAVE SURVIVAL INSTINCTS

PLAYING BS AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE CARD YOU HAVE TO PUT DOWN
WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING WITH THE GUY WHO HAS ALL 4 OF THAT CARD, YOUR FRIEND WHO KNOWS WHEN YOU LIE, AND THE GUY WHO CALLS BS ON EVERYTHING

ME AFTER TACO BELL
ON THE TOILET

My date took me to a thimble museum
but it was only sew-sew.

FIRST PRODUCTIVEDUCK LEFT, THEN PIRATE-CAPTAIN_EMEMEON
IF YOU HAVE/HAD ANY RESPECT FOR THEM, COMMENT ‚ÄúE AND D‚Äù IN THE COMMENTS

I've decided not to have kids
My kids are taking it pretty hard

I HAD TO REMIND HIM THAT IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF THE BOAT, OR THE MOTION OF THE OCEAN
BUT THE WHETHER THE BOAT IS ABLE TO STAY IN PORT UNTIL ALL PASSENGERS HAVE GOTTEN OFF.

MY BRAIN CELLS, SKIN CELLS AND HAIR CELLS CONTINUOUSLY DIE
BUT MY FAT CELLS SEEM TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE

WHEN SUMMER COMES TO AN END
AND YOU HEAR THE WORD SCHOOL

SO HARD GETTING POINTS
BECAUSE I'M NEW

THEY ALWAYS SAY "OK BOOMER"
BUT NEVER ASK "ARE YOU OK BOOMER?"

IDK WHY TF I'M CRYING
OH YEAH... HORMONES

When you can't fit anymore
pennies in the 5-gallon jug

WHEN YOU CREATE THE BEST MEME
AND IT DIDN'T GET ANY LIKE AND VIEW

THEY BANNED PLASTIC BAGS TODAY SO
WHAT WILL I LINE MY BATHROOM GARBAGE CAN WITH NOW?

THE LAST TIME THAT I CHANGED MY PROFILE PICTURE
I GOT 23 YIKES.

I CAN'T GO DRINKING ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY
BECAUSE THE BAR IS CLOSED DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

AND SO ENDS ANOTHER WEEK
WITHOUT ME BECOMING UNEXPECTEDLY RICH.

MY NEW PRINTER IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH MY IPAD
I NEED TO PRINT A RETURN LABEL TO SEND IT BACK

Had to throw out expired stuff from my spice rack
What a waste of thyme

I REPLIED TO A COMMENT ON A POLITICAL MEME ON IMGFLIP WHILE DRUNK
NOW I'M ENGAGED IN 3 DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS

WHEN YOU'RE BREAKING INSIDE
BUT YOU'RE THE STRONG FRIEND, SO YOU CAN'T SHOW IT

HELP I NEED MEME
TEMPLETS IN THE COMMENTS

I ASKED HIM TO GET THE DISHWASHER LOADED
HE BROUGHT ME A BOTTLE OF RED WINE

WHEN WOMEN WANT EQUAL RIGHTS
BUT IT MEANS THEY ALSO NEED TO BE DRAFTED WHEN WW3 STARTS

MY RAT PROBLEM IS GETTING SO BAD THAT
I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF NAMES FOR ALL OF THEM

WHY AREN‚ÄôT THOSE POLITICIANS LISTENING TO THE EXCELLENT ADVICE
MY DAD IS SHOUTING AT THEM DURING THE NEWS?

IF YOU RAISE YOUR CHILDREN, YOU SPOIL YOUR GRAND-KIDS
IF YOU SPOIL YOUR CHILDREN, YOU RAISE YOUR GRAND-KIDS

JUST HAD A REALLY GOOD MEME IDEA
FORGOT IT

My Wallet Is Like An Onion
When I Open It, It Makes Me Cry

I USED TO THINK 5 UPVOTES WAS GOOD
NOW I MADE THE FRONT PAGE AND KNOW I WILL NEVER GET 400 AGAIN

I WANT TO HAVE A MENTAL BREAKDOWN
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO

IS SHE CRYING OVER SOMETHING AWFUL THAT HAS HAPPENED
OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN AND THEY DO THAT SOMETIMES

18 YEARS AGO TODAY
TRAGEDY OCCURRED

WATCHING THE HALLMARK CHANNEL IS SO DEPRESSING
MY HOUSE NEVER LOOKS LIKE THAT FOR CHRISTMAS

MY LIFE IS 50% WONDERING IF IT IS TOO LATE FOR COFFEE
AND 50% WONDERING IF IT IS TOO EARLY FOR ALCOHOL.

A NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT EATING 2 EGGS A DAY INCREASES WEIGHT LOSS
SO I HAD 2 EGGS FOR BREAKFAST - THEY WERE IN THE CAKE I ATE

THE AVERAGE FUNERAL COSTS 7 TO 10 THOUSAND DOLLARS
I CAN'T AFFORD TO DIE

I INTERVIEWED FOR A JOB AND TOLD THE BOSS I WOULD GIVE 110% EFFORT
I FORGOT I WAS APPLYING FOR A JOB AS A STATISTICIAN

WHEN YOU REALIZE ALL YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
ARE MADE IN CHINA

ELON MUSK DID A LIVE STREAM IN A ROCKET GOING ON ORBIT
YET THERE ARE STILL FLAT EARTHERS

I HAVE TO PEE REALLY BAD
BUT MY BROTHERS ARE IN THE BATHROOMS TAKING DUMPS

IMGFLIP FEATURED MY STATUE MEME
BUT THEN THEY TOOK IT DOWN

I SPENT 10 MINUTES LOOKING FOR MY PHONE IN MY CAR
WHILE USING MY PHONE AS A FLASHLIGHT

GOING TO BED EARLY...NOT LEAVING MY HOUSE...NOT GOING TO A PARTY
MY CHILDHOOD PUNISHMENTS HAVE BECOME MY ADULT GOALS

YOUR EXPRESSION WHEN
THE TEACHER GIVES YOU YOUR TEST AND IT'S FLIPPED OVER

I SPENT HOURS TOSSING OUT EXPIRED SPICES
WHAT A WASTE OF THYME

I NEED MORE PETS BECAUSE
I AM RUNNING OUT OF PASSWORDS.

I WAS ATTACKED BY A GANG OF MIME ARTISTS YESTERDAY
THEY DID UNSPEAKABLE THINGS TO ME

ACCIDENTALLY WOKE UP MY HUSBAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
WITH MY WHINING DURING THE ANGRY STRUGGLE TO FIND MY SIDE OF THE BED SHEET

WHEN THE BOMBADEIRA SAYS
YOU ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH SILLICONE

JUST WHEN I THINK MY CONFIDENCE COULDN'T BE SHAKIER, SOME LOUSY WEBSITE
TELLS ME I HAVE A "WEAK PASSWORD".

BENT MY SELFIE STICK
NOW ALL MY SELFIES ARE SLANTED

"BE SOCIALLY ACTIVE" THEY SAID
"IT'LL BE FUN" THEY SAID

MY OCD
HAS ADHD

WHEN I SEE NOBODY
COMMENTS ON MY MEMES

NOT SURE IF I SHOULD WORRY MORE ABOUT THE SON THAT LOCKED ME
OUT OF MY BEDROOM OR THE SON THAT SHOWED ME HOW TO PICK THE LOCK

I HATE IT WHENEVER I‚ÄôM IN THE CAR AND I SEE ONE OF THOSE ROAD SIGNS THAT SAYS, ‚ÄúDRAW BRIDGE AHEAD‚Äù
AND I DON'T HAVE A PENCIL.

MY NEIGHBOUR ACCUSED ME OF STEALING LAUNDRY OFF HER CLOTHESLINE
I NEARLY SHIT HER PANTS

THE YULE LOG LOOKS TOO BIG
ON MY NEW TV

I ASKED FOR MY PIZZA TO BE CUT INTO QUARTERS AND THEY CUT IT INTO 8 SLICES
I CAN'T POSSIBLY EAT THAT MUCH

In the song, I can't figure out if Bingo was the dog's name or the farmer's name
It all seems too ambiguous to me.

I'M IN THIS DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM
AND I NOTICE THAT EVEN HIS OFFICE PLANTS HAVE DIED.

I TRIED TO FLIP MY OMELETTE OVER
NOW I‚ÄôM HAVING SCRAMBLED EGGS

I can't comment
til I have 1000 points

POWER'S OUT SO I CAN'T MAKE A PROPER ESPRESSO
HAVE TO RESORT TO MY STOVETOP MOKA POT

FIRETRUCKS
ARE ACTUALLY "WATERTRUCKS"

3RD GRADER AT CLASS PARTY
ONLY FRITOS LEFT

WHEN YOU WISH YOU HAD AT LEAST 1000 POINTS
SO YOU CAN FINALLY ANSWER COMMENTS WITH MEMES

THE LAST TIME I WAS SOMEONE‚ÄôS TYPE
I WAS DONATING BLOOD

WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY DATED
NO ONE BEFORE

WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT
HAVING KIDS IS A BIGGER COMMITMENT THAN YOU THOUGHT

WHEN EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT AREA 51
BUT NO ONE IS TALKIN BOUT TODAY IS THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOON LANDING

I GAVE MY OPINION IN A COMMENTS SECTION
AND SOMEONE CALLED ME AN "ASSHAT"

MY DATE HAS A VIRAL INTERNET PICTURE
IT WAS TAKEN IN WALMART

CAN‚ÄôT WEAR NIKE - CAN‚ÄôT WEAR LEVI‚ÄôS
IF WE BOYCOTT VICTORIA‚ÄôS SECRET, I‚ÄôM IN TROUBLE

Got a new iPhoneX with facial recognition
It dialed a cosmetic surgeon for me

WHEN YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANY MEME IDEAS
AND HAVE NOTHING TO POST

WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE THIS DONE
ME, WHY ARE WE STILL HERE JUST TO SUFFER!?

PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFENDED WHEN I BREASTFEED IN PUBLIC NEED TO SHUT UP
WHAT I'M DOING IS NATURAL AND STRENGTHENS THE BOND BETWEEN ME AND MY DOG

I USE TO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK BUT THROUGH HARD WORK
AND PERSEVERANCE I NOW LIVE DIRECT DEPOSIT TO DIRECT DEPOSIT

WHEN YOU'RE A KID, IT MAKES YOU FEEL PROUD WHEN SOMEONE SAYS "WOW! YOU'VE GOTTEN SO BIG SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU!"
AS AN ADULT, NOT SO MUCH.

I'M IN LOVE WITH A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW I EXIST
AND EVEN WORSE HE CAN PROVE IT

I've Always Thought My Neighbors Were Nice People
But Then They Put A Password On Their Wi-Fi

I GOT WASTED LAST NIGHT AND CUT MY OWN BANGS
IMAGINE THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME, THAT‚ÄôS IT.

FORTY YEARS AGO MY DOCTOR MOLESTED ME
WHEN I WAS BORN HE SLAPPED ME ON THE BUTT

IF I HAD 50 CENTS FOR EVERY FAILED MATH EXAM
I'D HAVE $6.30 RIGHT NOW

WHEN THE DOWNLOAD TIMER GOES FROM 54 MINUTES
TO 54 DAYS

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT I WAS WALKING ON A SANDY BEACH
WHICH EXPLAINS THE FOOTPRINTS IN THE CAT LITTER TRAY THIS MORNING

WENT TO AREA 51
ALL I GOT WAS AN INFLATABLE GREEN ALIEN AND A SUNBURN

MY BOYFRIEND BROKE UP WITH ME AT A RESTAURANT. I STARTED CRYING
EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS PROPOSING SO THEY STARTED CLAPPING

TRUTH BE TOLD, I'LL SLEEP WITH ALMOST ANYONE ON THE FIRST DATE
IF THEIR TEXTS HAVE GOOD SPELLING, GOOD GRAMMAR AND GOOD PUNCTUATION.

THAT MOMENT WHEN IMGFLIP
DOESNT FEATURE YOUR MEME THAT YOU SPENT HOURS THINKING OF..

ME
WATCHING MY FRONT PAGE MEME SLOWLY DRIFT TO THE BOTTOM NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN

MY GARDEN GNOMES ARE NEXT
I JUST KNOW IT

I HATE THE ONE THIN LINE OF DUST
THAT WON'T GET IN THE DUSTPAN

OUR FAMILY DOCTOR ASKED IF MY HUSBAND HAD TALKED TO ME ABOUT ABOUT HIS HAVING AN ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION
I HAD TO SAY IT NEVER CAME UP

MY COCKROACH PROBLEM IS NOT SO BAD
NOW, THANKS TO THE RATS

WHAT DO I REMEMBER ABOUT THE MIDGET THAT ATTACKED ME
VERY LITTLE

THE ONLY THING THAT EVER GOES DOWN ON ME
IS THE DAMN COMPUTER

I WASTED MY SKINNY YEARS
THINKING I WAS FAT

MY TEACHER ASKED ME TO PROVIDE A BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR EVERY WEBSITE WE VISITED DURING OUR RESEARCH TASK
AND I GOT IN TROUBLE BECAUSE "imgflip.com" WAS NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE THE ONLY ONE THERE

WE MET ON A DATING SITE

TAYLOR SWIFT
IS NOW A BOOMER

MY NEIGHBOR ACCUSED ME OF TAKING HER CLOTHES OFF THE LINE

When you thought you would have snacks for a week
But you ate them all in two days

ANOTHER 1ST TERM FRESHMAN
EXPLAINING PSYCHOLOGY

I DON‚ÄôT GET ANY SCREEN TIME
ON SCHOOL DAYS ANYMORE

ME WHEN PEOPLE FORGET
THAT IMGFLIP IS A MEME SITE, NOT FACEBOOK

ONE OF MY MEMES GOT 555 VIEWS
MY OCD AND MY EGO ARE SO HAPPY

WHEN YOU TURN OFF THE RADIO IN YOUR CAR
AND THEN TURN IT BACK ON AND IT FINISHED YOUR FAVORITE SONG

I HAVE NO FRIENDS HERE
ALSO ME : I‚ÄôM SORRY I CAN‚ÄôT HANG OUT UNTIL NEXT MONTH.

DEAR SLEEP:
I KNOW WE HAD PROBLEMS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER... BUT I LOVE YOU NOW

I SAW A GRAMMAR GOOF IN MY FEATURED MEME AND WILL HAVE TO DELETE IT, THEN RE-MAKE AND SUBMIT IT AGAIN
BUT NO SUBMISSIONS LEFT TODAY.

I'LL WORRY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
WHEN IT BEGINS TO AFFECT MY AMAZON ORDERS

I JUST SPENT 15MINS CHASING A DADDY LONG LEGS SPIDER AROUND MY KITCHEN
THEN I REALIZED IT WAS JUST A CRACK IN MY GLASSES

THEY TOLD ME MY GENERATION KEEPS GETTING OFFENDED BY EVERYTHING
I JUST HAD TO FIND A SAFE SPACE TO SIT DOWN AND CRY

MY LIFE IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH
AND NOW I HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH STREAM TO PUT A MEME IN

JUST WHEN I HAD THE GROCERY STORE MASTERED
THEY MOVED ALL THE AISLES AROUND

SOMEONE JUST HONKED TO GET ME OUT OF MY PARKING SPOT

MY MEME HAS MORE UPVOTES
THAN YOUR IDIOT IMAGE THATS #1

THE DINNER I WAS COOKING FOR MY FAMILY WAS GOING TO BE A SURPRISE
BUT THE FIRE TRUCKS RUINED IT

WHEN YOUR LITTLE CEASARS PIZZA
ISN'T HOT OR READY

I'm a grown adult, I work in a fast food restaurant, my boss is very cheap, I can't drive, my neighbor hates me, my best friend is jobless and dumb
And the worst part is, I live in a pineapple under the sea

WHEN YOUR PARENTS SIGN YOU UP
FOR SOMETHING YOU DON‚ÄôT WANNA DO

HE TEXTED ME "YOUR ADORABLE". I TEXTED BACK "YOU'RE ADORABLE"
NOW HE THINKS I LIKE HIM WHEN ALL I WAS DOING WAS CORRECTING HIS GRAMMAR.

I DON‚ÄôT HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT THE LATEST MEMES
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO COME UP WITH GOOD MEMES IS BY GOING THROUGH THE LATEST MEMES

I JUST WATCHED THE VIDEO OF MY WEDDING BACKWARDS
JUST SO I COULD SEE THE HAPPY ENDING WHERE I AM BACKING OUT OF THE CHURCH.

WHEN YOU THINK OF REALLY FUNNY CHRISTMAS MEMES
BUT CHRISTMAS IS OVER SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR TO SUBMIT THEM

QUARANTINE HAS ME RUNNING
MY BINGE-WATCH LIST TOO QUICKLY

I GOT SO MANY COMMENTS
IT TOOK 2 HOURS TO REPLY TO THEM ALL

WHEN I DRINK ALCOHOL, PEOPLE CALL ME "AN ACOHOLIC"

AND THEN REALIZING I HAVE 3 ESSAY

I'M ADDICTED TO HAVING MONEY IN MY BANK ACCOUNT
I SUFFER FROM WITHDRAWALS

I WANT TO KEEP EATING
BUT I'M FULL

WHEN YOU COME BACK AFTER MONTHS AWAY
AND NOBODY NOTICES YOU WERE GONE

APPARENTLY, I HAVE REACHED THE AGE WHERE MY BROAD MIND AND NARROW WAIST
HAVE TRADED PLACES.

GET HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE
GOT EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE THING I ACTUALLY NEEDED

I WAS TAKING CLASSES AT AN ORIGAMI STUDIO
BUT IT FOLDED.

I HAVE NO HOME I HAVE NO CONTROL I DON'T HAVE ANY SPACE AND I CAN'T SEE ANY ESCAPE
I'D SAY IS ABOUT TIME I GOT A NEW KEYBOARD

ME: WHEN I ACTUALLY STUDIED FOR A BIG TEST
ALSO ME: FINDS OUT THERE'S NO TEST

MY LANDSCAPER SAYS THAT I OUGHT TO INVEST
IN HEDGE FUNDS.

I Managed To Get A Job Working For A Pool Maintenance Company
But The Work Was Too Draining

I CAN'T FIND MY FAVOURITE RAP TRACKS ON THE INTERNET
I KEEP SPELLING THEIR TITLES CORRECTLY

MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN GONE FOR DAYS
I WONDER IF HE GOT EVERYTHING ON MY SHOPPING LIST

I'VE BEEN ON THIS SITE SO LONG
I NOW THINK IN MEMES

I'VE TRIED THAT JAPANESE DECLUTTERING TREND WHERE YOU HOLD EACH THING YOU OWN AND THROW OUT WHAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU JOY
SO FAR I'VE THROWN OUT ALL THE VEGETABLES AND THE ELECTRIC BILL

WHENEVER I THINK OF THE PAST
IT BRINGS BACK SO MANY MEMORIES

IM AFRAID OF CLOWNS
YET I KEEP DATING THEM

AND THE SHOWER RAN OUT OF HOT WATER

WHEN THE MEME YOU THOUGHT WAS SO FUNNY
ONLY GETS 15 VIEWS

HE THINKS THAT MONOGAMY
IS SOMETHING USED TO MAKE DINING ROOM TABLES.

THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE
PLUS SHIPPING AND HANDLING

MY RECIPE FOR VODKA FLAVOURED SAUSAGE NEVER CAUGHT ON
IT WAS THE ABSOLUT WURST

NEW YEAR/NEW ME
SAME SAYING/SAME RESULTS

Using a public restroom always reminds me
how much better I am at flushing a toilet than a lot of other people on this planet

I ALWAYS HAVE SOME MONTH LEFT.

THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH ROOM IN THE PAN
FOR THE AMOUNT OF BACON I WANT TO EAT

I DON'T PLAY POKEMON GO
SO I WASN'T INCLUDED IN ANY CONVERSATIONS AT WORK TODAY

WHEN YOUR SON GIVE YOU A SCRATCH OFF TICKET AND YOU WIN $50,000
THEN YOU REALISE THAT IT'S FAKE

IF I HAD A COOKING SHOW IT WOULD BE CALLED
"DO YOU SMELL SOMETHING BURNING"

CURRENTLY HAVING A HURRICANE
IF THE POWER GOES OUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO MEME

I WANTED TO LOSE 10 POUNDS THIS SUMMER
NOW I ONLY HAVE 13 POUNDS TO GO

PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I SAY RACIAL SLURS TO HURT OTHERS
I'M OPPRESSED

PILATES !! I THOUGHT YOU SAID
COME OVER FOR PIE AND LATTE

I FEEL GUILTY FOR BEATING MY KIDS
BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT THEY SUCK AT SCRABBLE

I CAN'T BELIEVE I LOST MY BOYFRIEND
I MADE SURE TO KEEP THE LAST MILKY WAY HIDDEN. HOW COULD THEY EVER MELT?

NOBODY UPVOTES MY MEMES
HOW WILL I LIVE NOW?

I HAVE ABOUT 4000 POINTS LEFT TO GO UNTIL 100000
PLEASE UPVOTE THIS MEME TO HELP ME GET THERE

LIFE IS A PARTY
AND I'M THE PI√ëATA

I OPENED AND LICKED ICECREAM AT WALMART THEN PUT IT BACK ON THE SHELF
NOW IM IN A WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY FOR 20 YEARS

WHY IS IT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PUT TWIST TIES ON BAGS
NEVER LEARNED "RIGHTY TIGHTY, LEFTY LOOSEY"?

IT'S GETTING SO HARD TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL THESE DAYS
AND FIND SOMETHING TO BE OUTRAGED OVER, THAT ISN'T ALREADY TAKEN

WHEN NO ONE LIKES YOUR MEME
AND YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS

I THOUGHT OF A GOOD IDEA FOR A MEME
I FORGOT IT FEW MINUTES LATER

MY MOM USED TO SAY:
IF YOU GIVE THEM ENOUGH ROPE, THEY WILL HANG THEMSELVES

IT'S STOLEN MEMES WEEK
NO ONE STOLE MY MEMES

WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT
"FEATURED MEME" MEANS NOTHING

MY MEME COMMENTS ARE GETTING MORE UPVOTES
THAN MY MEMES

I JUST PAID THREE DOLLARS IN QUARTERS TO PUT AIR IN MY TIRES
THIS INFLATION IS OUT OF CONTROL

SO, TWO INTERESTING THINGS I LEARNED AT THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM TODAY
LIGHTENING BUGS ARE ACTUALLY BEETLES AND I HATE CHILDREN

I DRANK SO MUCH VODKA LAST NIGHT
THAT THIS MORNING I WOKE UP WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT.

TAKING MY SUNGLASSES OUT OF MY TODDLER'S HANDS WHILE HE'S NAPPING IN THE CAR
IS THE CLOSEST I WILL COME TO DIFFUSING A BOMB

ASKED THE GUYS IN THE MEAT DEPARTMENT
IF THEY HAD LITTLE WIENERS!

ALL I WANTED WAS A BAG OF FRITOS FROM THE VENDING MACHINE
BUT MY LAST DOLLAR BILL IS TOO CRINKLED

WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT YOU WERENT PREGNANT
YOU WERE JUST TOO FAT

I AM OUT OF OREO COOKIES
I WILL HAVE TO EAT REAL FOOD FOR DINNER

ONCE MY DAD TOOK ME TO AN ORPHANAGE
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE

I AM WORKING WITH 4 TEENAGERS TONIGHT
IT'S SO OBVIOUS HOW OLD I AM NOW

FOR HALLOWEEN I‚ÄôM DRESSING AS A SCHOOL KID TRYING
TO SELL YOU SOME OVERPRICED WRAPPING PAPER

I‚ÄôM NOT CRAZY
THE VOICES TELL ME I AM ENTIRELY SANE

MY HUSBAND IS ATTRACTIVE IN HIS OWN WAY
SOMETIMES IT JUST TAKES THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF WINE TO SEE IT

DAD TOOK THE BUGATTI
I HAVE TO DRIVE THE I8

SOMEONE STOLE MY THESAURUS
I HAVE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW ANGRY I AM

WHY DO PEOPLE
DELETE THEIR PROFILES WHEN THEY LEAVE?

SO ACCORDING TO THE COOKING CHANNEL, I'VE BEEN MAKING SCRAMBLED EGGS WRONG
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE

I BENT DOWN TO PICK SOMETHING UP
THE WIRE ON MY 30 DOLLAR HEADPHONES CAUGHT ON MY KNEE, RIPPED THE EARBUDS OUT OF MY EARS, AND NOW ONLY ONE OF THE BUDS WORKS.

He said we were going to see a good zombie movie
HE TOOK ME TO SEE THE DEAD DEAD DONT DIE

WHEN YOU WALK INTO A RESTAURANT WITH FREE WIFI
AND THE WIFI HAS A PASSWORD

I'M SORRY IF I COME ACROSS AS SARCASTIC, OUTSPOKEN AND OPINIONATED
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I AM SARCASTIC, OUTSPOKEN AND OPINIONATED

SINGLE GUY BUYING 75" TV
TV TOO BIG TO SET UP ALONE

WHEN SOMEONE STEALS YOUR MEME
AND THEY GET MORE UPVOTES

JANUARY
THE "MONDAY" MONTH OF THE YEAR

TO THE PERSON WHO STOLE MY V CARD
I HOPE YOU TAKE REFUNDS

I KNOW HOW TO GET FRAZZLED
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET UNFRAZZLED AGAIN

AND THEN HE TOLD ME
THAT WAS AS GOOD AS IT GETS

STATE PUNS
SUCH MISSOURI

WHEN YOUR DAD GIVES YOU CANDY AND SAYS IT OK IF YOU EAT IT
THEN YOU ASK YOUR MOM IF YOU CAN EAT THE CANDY AND SHE SAYS NO

HE ASKED ME WHY I WAS STANDING ON MY HEAD
I TOLD HIM I KNEW HE COULDN'T GET IT UP AND WAS HOPING HE COULD DROP IT IN

I REALLY WANT TO UPGRADE TO THE LATEST IPHONE
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID I'LL DIE IF I SELL THE OTHER KIDNEY TOO

Bought alcohol today
Cashier didn‚Äôt ask for ID

MY RATING IS GOING DOWN
ON THE ALL TIME TOP USERS LIST

THREE WEEKS IN A ROW
MY NAME WASN'T ON ANY OF THE COKE BOTTLES

WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING FINDING DORY
AND YOUR PARENTS DECIDE ECHOLOCATION PROMOTES WITCHCRAFT

I WANNA USE STEAK SAUCE
BUT THE STEAK CAME OUT SO DELICIOUS

WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO
PAGE 2 OF THE GOOGLE SEARCH

I TEXTED A SICK FRIEND
I THOUGHT "LOL" MEANT LOTS OF LOVE

I MADE GUACAMOLE WITH JALAPE√ëOS FOR DINNER TWO HOURS AGO
AND JUST WIPED MY EYE

WHEN 4 YR OLDS BE SWEARING
AND THE PARENTS LAUGH

I BOUGHT AN AWESOME WATCH THE OTHER DAY, IT WAS WATERPROOF, SHOCKPROOF, FIREPROOF, BULLETPROOF, ACIDPROOF, CHILDPROOF & SCRATCHPROOF
I LOST IT

NO GIRL EVER TRIED TO INSULT ME
BY MOONING ME

I JUST YAWNED ON THE BUS
AND TWO DUDES GAVE ME THEIR PHONE NUMBERS.

When it's cleavage week
But your 15 and don't dare to open Imgflip for a week

I REALLY NEED A DAY
BETWEEN SATURDAY AND SUNDAY

IMGFLIP
STARTED FEATURING CLICKBAIT ADS

SOME DAYS I ASTOUND
MYSELF WITH MY WITTINESS
OTHER DAYS I TRY TO GET OUT OF MY CAR WITH MY SEATBELT STILL ON

PHONE IS JUST BARELY TOO BIG
TO TYPE WITH ONE HAND

WHEN YOU RESEARCH JAWS
AND THE SHARK KEEPS POPPING UP

WHEN YOU TRY TO DIP AN OREO INTO MILK
AND THE CUP IS TOO SMALL

WHEN PAYTON MANNING
SEES THE COLTS

I GAVE MY HUSBAND A $100 GIFT CARD FOR BASS PRO
NOW HE JUST NEEDS TO COME UP WITH $35,687.00 FOR THE BOAT HE WANTS

IT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT BILLS TRAVEL THROUGH THE MAIL
FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN CHECKS.

SOME PEOPLE NEED AUTOCORRECT
FOR THERE LIVES

WENT TO AREA 51
THERE R NO ALIENS

I WANTED AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BUT
THERE WAS A LIMIT OF ONE PER CUSTOMER

THE ONLY THING THAT FITS ME IN THIS STORE
IS THE SCARVES

I WANT TO MAKE A FIRST WORLD PROBLEM MEME
BUT I CAN‚ÄôT THINK OF AN IDEA

MY HEART SKIPPED A BEAT WHEN HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD LIKE TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE
THEN HE SENT ME OFF TO WALMART WITH A LIST

MY BROTHER
ATE THE LAST DORITO BAG

ALL I WANT TO DO IS SPEAK TO A REPRESENTATIVE
IF I KEEP HEARING PLEASE PRESS!!!!...I JUST CAN'T OMG

MY DOG USED TO CHASE PEOPLE ON A BIKE ALOT
SO I HAD TO TAKE HIS BIKE AWAY

I'M SORRY GUYS
THIS MIGHT BE GOODBYE

I JUST WANT SOMEONE TO SEE ME
THE WAY BOB ROSS SEES ALASKA

GRAMMAR
MY WORSTEST ENEMY

WHEN IT'S YOUR TIME OF THE MONTH
BUT YOU RAN OUT OF CHOCOLATE

WHENEVER I
HAVE CHORES TO DO

WHEN PEOPLE
START AN IRRELEVANT CONVERSATION IN MY COMMENTS

I JUST WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET
I DON'T HAVE ANY ROOM IN THE FRIDGE FOR WHAT I BOUGHT

I'VE SPENT OVER $200,000 RAISING MY CHILDREN
AND THAT WAS JUST FOR THE ALCOHOL TO DEAL WITH THEM

I COULDN‚ÄôT STAND SEEING ALL OF THOSE RED NOTIFICATION NUMBERS ON MY HUSBAND‚ÄôS PHONE
SO I CLEARED THEM

WORST DOCUMENTED CASE OF
SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER
RUNS FROM
AUGUST 15TH
THROUGH JUNE 1ST
OF COURSE IT‚ÄôS ME

MY CHARGER ISN'T LONG ENOUGH
TO LET ME COMFORTABLY REST AND USE MY PHONE

I'VE BEEN IN THIS WAITING ROOM SO LONG
I THINK I'M NOW RECOVERED FROM THE FLU.

THERE'S AN ABORTION BAN IN ALABAMA
MY BROTHER AND I ARE GONNA HAVE A CHILD WITH DOWN SYNDROME NOW

THOUGHT I LOST MY AIRPODS TODAY AT SCHOOL
TURNS OUT THEY WERE IN MY POCKET

DO I BUY MY SON A PAIR OF AIR JORDANS
OR MAKE THE MORTGAGE AND SUV PAYMENTS THIS MONTH

I DIDN'T SAVE ANY MONEY
BY SWITCHING TO GEICO

I WANT TO QUIT MY JOB AND PURSUE MY DREAMS
BUT MY BOSS KEEPS GIVING ME RAISES

AS A KID, I WAS MADE TO WALK THE PLANK
WE COULDN'T AFFORD A DOG

ONE WEEK ENDS
ANOTHER WEEK BEGINS

I SPENT TWO HOURS AT THE BEAUTY SHOP
THAT WAS ONLY FOR AN ESTIMATE

WHEN YOU LEASON TO
CHIPMUNKS OLD TOWN ROAD

I SAID I WISHED HE LOVED ME AS MUCH AS HIS FISHING REELS
SO WHEN HE WAS FINISHED, HE WIPED ME DOWN WITH A DAMP CLOTH AND PUT ME IN THE CUPBOARD

WHEN YOU'RE SO PALE
YOU GET MISTAKEN FOR A GHOST IN GROUP PHOTO'S

THE SADNESS YOU FEEL WHEN
YOUR MEME SLOWLY DISAPPEAR FROM THE FRONT PAGE

WHEN YOU HAVE POTTERY BARN TASTE
ON A TARGET BUDGET

I AM LIVING PROOF THAT HAVING A GOAL, AND A DREAM AND STRUGGLING HARD TO ATTAIN IT
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK.

MY MEME MADE THE FRONT PAGE
BUT IT'S ALL THE WAY AT THE BOTTOM

WHEN THE PACKAGE SAYS:
'DON'T EAT RAW COOKIE DOUGH'

YA GOTTA LOVE WHEN THE PRESCRIPTION ON YOUR GLASSES RUN OUT
WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET.

WHEN MY HUSBAND PROMISED TO GO WITH ME TO THE LABOR DAY SALE AT TARGET
AND HE GOES TO A LABOR DAY COOKOUT WITH HIS BUDDIES INSTEAD

WHEN YOU GET YOUR DISNEY+ LOGIN
BUT HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

WHEN BUGHA SEES YOU BUILDING A ONE BY ONE IN 15 MINUTES
HE IS HOPELESS

MY DAD TALKS ON HIS CELL PHONE THE SAME WAY
A GI TALKS ON A FIELD PHONE DURING COMBAT

WHEN THE WIFI IS DOWN
THAT MEANS I CANT PLAY MINECRAFT HUNGRY GAMES

NOT GONNA BE ACTIVE FOR A
FEW DAYS

I discarded the Hamburger Helper box before reading all the directions
I had to reach my hand into the garbage to retrieve it

THE PROBLEM WITH MY BOYFRIEND IS THAT I‚ÄôM A NIGHT PERSON
AND HE‚ÄôS MARRIED.

SO I JUST GOT BACK FROM SAM‚ÄôS CLUB
NOW I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW I‚ÄôM GOING TO USE 7 POUNDS OF POWDERED SUGAR

THE COMMENT SECTION NEEDS AN 'UPVOTE ALL' BUTTON
I CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO DO ALL OF THIS MANUALLY

MY HEAD HURTS SO BAD AND I KNOW WHY
EATING HEALTHY, HAVING WITHDRAWALS

BOUGHT A PAIR OF SHOES WITH MEMORY SOLE INSERTS
NO MORE FORGETTING WHY I WALKED INTO THE KITCHEN

BUT I SPENT HOURS ON PHOTOSHOPPING A MEME
THAT NO ONE WILL SEE

ONCE I CLICKED ON INTERNET EXPLORER
THEN I HAD TO WAIT FOR IT TO LOAD TO CLOSE IT

I TOLD A CLIENT OF MY PSYCHIC SERVICES THAT HE WOULD FEEL THE IMPACT OF A GREAT FORTUNE
AN OBESE BILLIONAIRE FELL ON HIM FROM HIS 20TH FLOOR PENTHOUSE

MY FACE WHEN I SEE
MILLENIALS THROWING AWAY CULTURES AND TRADITIONS AND THEN BLAMING GEN Z KIDS FOR EVERYTHING

I FORGOT TO CHARGE MY TOOTHBRUSH
NOW I HAVE TO MOVE MY ARM TO BRUSH MY TEETH

CRIED BECAUSE MY HOUSE FLOODED
MADE THINGS WORSE

WANT TO TRY POPEYE'S CHICKEN SANDWICH
BUT DON'T WANT TO GET STABBED

MY CRUSH JUST TOLD ME HE LOVES ME
LIKE A SISTER

WHEN U STEP IN A PUDDLE
AND YOUR SHOES AND SOCKS GET WET

I ASKED MY HUSBAND IF HE WOULD PLAY SOME ROLE REVERSAL GAMES IN THE BEDROOM
SO HE SAID HE HAD A HEADACHE ROLLED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP

I LOST MY CAT
FOR REAL

I CHOSE A BAD TRANSLATION PROGRAM FOR WORK I WAS DOING FOR SOME CHINESE CLIENTS
NOW I HAVE TO CAREFUL MONKEY DUNG THE ERECTION IN THE SODA POOL

WHEN YOUR ANXIETY
HAS ANXIETY

WHEN YOUR MEME GETS FEATURED
BUT HAS 0 UPVOTES AND ONLY 13 VIEWS

Raydog hasn‚Äôt posted in over 2 weeks
But he‚Äôs still accumulating more points than me in a week.

MY HUSBAND SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ME IN LINGERIE
HE SAID HE WANTED TO SEE THE VICTORIA SECRET MODELS IN LINGERIE

HE SAID HES WORTH A COUPLE MILLION BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET
ITS IMGFLIP POINTS

Never thought I'd see the day when
Members of KISS would prefer bran muffins over pizza

I live in a country of free speech
So why can‚Äôt I afford to pay my phone bill?

I WISH PEOPLE COULD ACCEPT THEMSELVES JUST THE WAY THEY ARE
INSTEAD ON RUINING THEIR HEALTH FOR BEAUTY STANDARDS...

THEY ASK YOU HOW YOU ARE
ME: *THROWS A ELMO STUFFY*

WHEN YOU'RE BUSY AFTER SCHOOL
AND YOU HAVE TONS OF HOMEWORK TO DO

THE NEAREST POPEYE'S CHICKEN
IS A HUNDRED MILES AWAY

SO THAT'S ANOTHER PRINCE
I'LL NEVER MARRY

WATCHING A VIDEO ABOUT CATS MEOWING
PEOPLE STILL MANAGED TO BRING POLITICS INTO THE COMMENTS

URGENT SEARCH 4 FEMININE CARE ISLE
In Vain! STORE BANNED IT FOR BEING SEXIST

WHEN THE REST OF THE CLASS IS ARGUING WHETHER THE ANSWER IS 4 OR 5
AND YOU GOT 180

A GUY HELD THE DOOR OPEN FOR ME
NOW I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM

I have 25 episodes of ‚ÄúHoarders‚Äù on my DVR
I‚Äôve watched them all but can‚Äôt bring myself to delete them

MY BROKER CALLED TO TELL ME THAT THE STOCK THAT WE BOUGHT WHICH WOULD ENABLE ME TO RETIRE AT 55
NOW HAS MY RETIREMENT AGE AT 105.

WHEN YOUR BOOK
RUNS OUT OF BATTERIES

I HAD TO LEAVE IMGFLIP FOR A WEEK
IN ORDER TO AVOID ENDGAME SPOILERS

WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO WORK, AND THE GUY IN FRONT OF YOU AT THE ONE-STOP
SPENDS 10 MINUTES BUYING SCRATCH-OFFS.

WHEN YOU WANT MORE MONEY
BUT NOT MORE PROBLEMS

MCDONALD'S CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE
DOESN'T TASTE AS NICE WITH A PAPER STRAW

I SAW AN AD FOR FORTNITE
ON IMGFLIP

I KISSED SANTA LAST NIGHT
NOW PAM IN HUMAN RESOURCES WANTS TO TALK TO ME

I LOVED THE JACKET AND IT COSTED ONLY 1000$
BUT THEN I SAW THE 5$ SHIPPING CHARGES

ONE OF THESE DAYS
I'LL HAVE MY OWN TEMPLATE

MY HUSBAND WANTS ME TO DO IT 2 NIGHTS IN A ROW
I DESPISE COOKING

FRESH MEMES? BUT THEY'VE ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE
WELL, MOST OF THEM

MY REFRIGERATOR IS SO FULL
I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR MY LEFTOVERS FROM THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT

I ASKED OUT BAD LUCK BRIAN ON A DATE
HE REJECTED ME FOR OVERLY ATTACHED GIRLFRIEND

IMGFLIP DOESN'T HAVE
PURPLE COLOR FOR CAPTIONS

WHEN YOU GET THE 30 SECOND AD
WITH NO SKIP

IN I THE ONLY ONE
THAT ACTUALLY LIKES SQUIDWARDS PAINTINGS?

I LOST IMGFLIP POINTS, BECAUSE THE MEME I SUBMITTED DIDN'T MET THE STREAMING REQUIREMENT
1 UPVOTE = HELP FOR ME

SOMEONE PLEASE TELL MY HUSBAND THAT NO ONE CAN HEAR HIM
YELLING HIS DRIVING TIPS TO THEM FROM INSIDE OUR CAR

WHEN ALL I WANT TO DO IS CHANGE THE SHEETS ON THE BED
AND THE CATS THINK IT'S PLAYTIME!

THE MOMENT YOU REALIZE TEA IS LETHAL TO FROGS
AND KERMIT IS COMMITTING SUCIDE BY TEA

AFTER ALMOST ONLY USING GIFS AND MEMES TO COMMUNICATE
I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE

WHEN THE WAITRESS WALKS BY
WITH THE FOOD YOU THOUGHT WAS YOURS

WHY IS IT THAT EVERY HOUSE-PLANT THAT I BUY
HAS APPARENTLY LOT ITS WILL TO LIVE?

JUST WHEN I START TO SLEEP WELL
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME HAPPENS

I JUST REALIZED I'M A MAN
USING A WOMAN'S TEMPLATE

CHRISTMAS HAS ME SO BROKE
THAT IF I WENT TO KFC... I'D HAVE TO LICK OTHER PEOPLE'S FINGERS

I WAS CALLED "RACIST"
BECAUSE I TOLD MY KID TO PLAY ON THE "MONKEY BARS"

HE SAID "I WILL ALWAYS CHERISH THE ORIGINAL MISCONCEPTIONS
THAT I HAD ABOUT YOU WHEN WE FIRST MET."

MY SISTER CAME OVER WITH HER TWO YOUNG SONS SO I HAD TO CHILDPROOF MY ENTIRE HOUSE
BY CLOSING ALL THE BLINDS AND NOT ANSWERING THE DOOR

CAN SKIP AD IN FIVE SECONDS
AD IS FIVE SECONDS LONG

HE SAID HE LOVED ME AND THAT I WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN HIS LIFE
BUT ALL HE DOES IS MAKE MEMES

WHEN IT'S SO COLD OUT
YOU HAVE TO WEAR TWO PAIRS OF PAJAMAS TO WAL-MART

I'M SO HUNGRY
BUT WE ONLY HAVE LEFTOVERS

THE ICE CREAM IS TOO HARD
I CAN'T SCOOP IT OUT

WHEN SHE SAYS SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WEIRD TO HERSELF YET
BUT SHES ACTUALLY LYING AND TRYING HER BEST TO LIE TO YOU AND EVERYONE.

HAD TO WATCH SUPERBOWL ON 42-INCH SCREEN
AND IT WASN'T EVEN A SMART TV

I WENT TO A SHINDIG
I ONLY DUG UP A THIGH, A FOREARM AND THREE RIBS...

WHEN ONE OF THE COMMENTS GETS
MORE UP VOTES THAN YOUR MEME

I ASKED ALEXA ON MY AMAZON ECHO TO SEND ME A HANDSOME FIREFIGHTER FOR A BOYFRIEND
SHE SET MY HOUSE ON FIRE

WHEN YOUR SCHOOL
BANS FIDGET SPINNERS

WHEN YOU REALIZE
WINTER BREAK IS GOING TO END

WHEN YOUR ONLY MISTAKE ON YOUR PAPER
IS A CAPITALIZATION ERROR

WHEN SOMEBODY'S COMMENT
GETS MORE VIEWS AND UPVOTES THAN YOUR BEST MEME

I DON'T MIND MY NEIGHBOR INSISTING I EAT MORE BANANAS FOR THE POTASSIUM, OR EVEN THAT HE WATCHES ME DO SO WITH BINOCULARS THROUGH HIS WINDOW
BUT WHEN HE CALLED AND SAID THAT CLOTHES HINDER DIGESTION . . .

UNLESS F STANDS FOR FANTASTIC
I'M SCREWED

HOW DO I GET THE TURKEY
IN THE MICROWAVE!

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS AT MY HOUSE
THE ONE I THINK I‚ÄôM HAVING AND THE ONE MY HUSBAND HEARS

DID ANYONE ELSE KNOW THAT YOU CAN PUT THE JELLY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BREAD
MY 4 YEAR OLD JUST TOLD ME THAT I DID AND NOW HER WHOLE DAY IS RUINED

PRETENDING TO BE SAD FOR YOUR FRIEND
WHEN THEY BREAK UP WITH YOUR EX

STARTING ON FRIDAY I AM TAKING A BREAK FROM IMGFLIP
I WILL MISS YOU ALL

WHEN YOU PUT TOO MUCH WATER
IN YOUR INSTANT HOT COCOA

EVERY TIME THAT I AM IN THE EXPRESS LANE, THE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME
ALWAYS HAS ONE ITEM THAT HAS NO PRICE THAT IS KNOWN IN THE CHECK-OUT COMPUTER.

Thought I heard a dying cat
Then I remembered my daughter was practicing for choir tryouts

I DIDNT GET 300 GIFTS FOR CHRISTMAS
WAAAAAAAAAAAA

I SENT A TWEET TO LEGO
AND GOT BLOCKED

WHEN YOUR TAKING A SHOWER
BUT THEN YOU FORGET TO BRING YOUR TOWEL

WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF COFFEE
IN THE MORNING

NICKELODEON BROUGHT BACK "ALL THAT", SOON THEY'LL BRING BACK "ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?"
BUT SADLY, NOT "THE ADVENTURES OF PETE & PETE" OR "CLARISSA EXPLAINS IT ALL"

I MISS THE DAYS WHEN TYLENOL
TAMPERING WAS MY BIGGEST CONCERN.

WHEN YOU ARE WASHING THE DISHES
AND YOU REALIZE THAT THE WATER BILL IS GOING UP

I THOUGHT IT WAS THE DRYER MAKING MY CLOTHES SHRINK
TURNS OUT, IT WAS THE REFRIGERATOR

Some days I wish
I could just be marooned with the gang on Gilligan‚Äôs Island

PEOPLE USED TO LAUGH AT ME WHEN I SAID I WANTED TO BE A COMEDIAN
WELL THEY'RE NOT LAUGHING NOW

PEOPLE THINK I'M A "RESPONSIBLE ADULT"
BUT I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I'M DOING

WOMEN WILL NEVER BE EQUAL TO MEN
UNTIL THEY CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET, WITH A BALD HEAD AND BEER GUT, AND STILL THINK THEY ARE SEXY.

MY GRANDSON CAN NOW REACH THE LIGHT SWITCHES. SO, DON'T COME TO MY HOUSE
UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY INTO RAVES OR WANT TO HAVE A SEIZURE.

SCIENTISTS SAY YOU FEEL MOMENTARILY HAPPY WHEN YOU GET A TEXT OR NOTIFICATION
I DON'T GET ANY NOTIFICATIONS

I'VE JUST MADE A FUN POLITICAL REPOST GIF ABOUT GAMING
AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHERE TO POST IT!

WHEN UR FAVORITE SHOW ENDS
HEHE

DOES MY BLACK AND WHITE STRIPY TOP
GO IN WITH THE WHITES OR THE COLOREDS WASH?

ASKED HOW MUCH TO REMOVE THE "HILLARY 2016" BUMPER STICKER
THEY TOLD ME TO SCRAP THE CAR

THE ONLY PERSON I EVER SPEAK TO
IS THE PIZZA DELIVERY GUY

I INVITED MY FATHER OVER FOR DINNER
HE SAID IT DEPENDS ON WHAT I'M FEEDING HIM

I JUST FOUND DIAMONDS ON MINECRAFT
AND I DIED IN THE LAVA

HOW I FEEL WHEN MY MOM
SHOWS ME A MEME OFF OF FACEBOOK

I'M OUT OF VEGGIE WASH SPRAY
AND MY PENDING WAL-MART GROCERY DELIVERY ORDER IS UNDER THE $50 FREE DELIVERY LIMIT

MY HUSBAND THINKS HE'S GANDHI
HE WALKS AROUND IN DIAPERS AND WON'T EAT

I LOST ALL THE TABS
OPENED ON MY COMPUTER

ME REALIZING THAT
I CANT TURN IMGFLIP INTO A FULLTIME JOB

I CAN RELATE TO TURKEY'S
MOST MEN ONLY LIKE THE BREASTS

EVERY GUY I BRING HOME TO MEET MY PARENTS MY FATHER HATES. MY FRIEND SUGGESTED I BRING HOME A GUY EXACTLY LIKE MY DAD
I TRIED THAT AND MY MOTHER CAN'T STAND HIM

I SAID ORGASM INSTEAD OF ORGANISM
IN FRONT OF 30 THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS

THAT MOMENT
WHEN YOU POUR YOURSELF SOME CEREAL, THEN YOU REALIZE THERE IS NO MILK

WHEN YOUR MEME ONLY GETS SUBMITTED
AND NOT FEATURED

I'M ALMOST OUT OF SUBMISSIONS
ON IMGFLIP

MICHAEL JACKSON DIED
10 YEARS AGO TODAY

MY MEMES ARE BETTER IN MY MIND
THAN ON A TEMPLATE

WHEN YOUR TEACHER SAYS YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC IF YOU HAVE EARBUDS
AND YOU DON'T HAVE EARBUDS

WHEN YOU DIDN'T DRINK ANYTHING
BUT WAKE UP FEELING HUNGOVER

I HAD TO GET OUT OF BED TO DRIVE THE KIDS TO SCHOOL
THEY ARE TOO AFRAID OF CLOWNS TO WALK

I CAN'T CHOOSE
WHICH SCENTED CANDLE TO BURN

I SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON IMGFLIP
I CATCH MYSELF RESPONDING IN MEMES IN REAL LIFE

I STILL HAVE TO WRAP 20 OR 30 GIFTS
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT

I‚ÄôLL CALL IT A ‚ÄúSMART PHONE‚Äù THE DAY I YELL, ‚ÄúWHERE‚ÄôS MY FREAKING PHONE?!‚Äù
AND IT SHOUTS BACK, ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM HERE! UNDER THE PILE OF CLOTHES!"

WHEN YOU PLUG YOUR PHONE CHARGER IN
BUT FORGET TO TURN THE POWER SWITCH ON

I TOLD HIM THE DISH WASHER WAS ACTING UP
HE TOLD MY MOTHER TO ACT RIGHT OR BE PUT IN A SHADY NURSING HOME

TWICE IN TWO DAYS
I THOUGHT OF A REPLY SO DIRTY I DIDN'T WANT TO POST IT...AND I'M NOT EVEN AT WORK

THOUGHT HE NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION
FOUND OUT HE WAS ON HIS WAY HOME FROM A ZOMBIE WALK

IN ORDER TO LOSE WEIGHT I STARTED WALKING 10 MILES A DAY
AFTER A MONTH I WAS 300 MILES FROM HOME

MY HOUSE IS SO MESSY
THE ROBBERS THOUGHT THE HOUSE WAS ALREADY RANSACKED

YOU‚ÄôLL FIND YOURSELF HANDCUFFED TO A HOSPITAL GURNEY ONLY SO MANY TIMES IN YOUR LIFE
DON‚ÄôT WASTE THOSE TIMES

I DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD IDEAS
FOR 'FUN' MEMES

THE FEAR OF LONG WORDS IS
HIPPOPOTAMONSTROUSESQUIPEDALIAPHOBIA...

WHEN YOU FINISH BINGE WATCHING ALL THE
HIGH SCHOOL MUSICALS

THE REMOTE'S OVER THERE
BUT I'M OVER HERE

WEN UR MOM TRY TO BE ALL HIP BECAUSE SHE TEXTS WTF
BECAUSE SHE THINKS IT MEANS WOW THAT'S FANTASTIC.

MY DIAMOND EARRINGS
KEEP SCRATCHING MY I PHONE

THAT FEELING WHEN YOU
GET CAUGHT BY SCAMMERS SAYING THAT YOU WON WHEN IT‚ÄôS A FAKE...

I CANT THINK OF
A SINGLE MEME TODAY

I USED TO HAVE WINTER FAT
BUT NOW I HAVE SPRING ROLLS

IT‚ÄôS THE END OF JUNE
NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO HOT JULY

I SURE BUY MYSELF A LOT OF PRESENTS
FOR SOMEONE WHO HATES THEMSELVES

WHEN I REALIZE I HAVE MADE THE CLASSIC TEACHER MISTAKE
ASSIGNING MORE THAN I CAN PHYSICALLY GRADE

WHEN YOU THINK YOUR MEME IS DOING PRETTY GOOD
AND GO SEARCHING FOR IT ON THE HOTLIST BUT END UP GIVING UP AFTER 20 MINS -> HTTPS://IMGFLIP.COM/?PAGE=72

TURNED THE PILLOW
STILL HOT

WE RAN OUT OF PINK HIMALAYAN SALT
SO I HAD TO USE THE PLAIN ORGANIC SEA SALT

THE IMGFLIP SITE CRASHED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THIS EVENING
I WAS ACTUALLY FORCED TO SPEND TIME ON FACEBOOK

I HAVE MIXED DRINKS
ABOUT FEELINGS

END OF THE WEEK AGAIN
NO UPVOTES AGAIN

WENT TO MCDONALD'S AND ORDERED A 10 PIECE NUGGET
THERE WERE ONLY 9 PIECES IN THE BOX AND NOW I HAVE TO DRIVE OVER A MILE BACK

MCDONALDS GAVE ME 5 CHICKEN NUGGETS
INSTEAD OF 6

JUST REALIZED THAT I'M BILINGUAL
I NOW SPEAK "MEME"

I THINK I‚ÄôM GETTING TOO OLD FOR IMGFLIP
BECAUSE I DON‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND HALF THE MEMES ON HERE

Fell in love with a guy who works with animals
Found out hes a butcher

IM ABOUT TO HIT A MILLION POINTS
BUT IM STILL STRUGGLING WITH THE DECISION TO POST A SELFIE OR NOT

HAVEN'T BEEN ON IMGFLIP FOR 12 HOURS
20 NOTIFICATIONS AND I STILL HAVE TO MAKE 3 MEMES

WE HAVE FOOD, SHELTER, WATER, LAND, FREE WIFI AND TRANSPORTATION
BUT AMERICA SEEMS SO MUCH BETTER

WHEN YOU LOVE JAWS
BUT THE SHARK STILL SCARES YOU

I FINALLY FOUND A MAN WHO MEETS MY STANDARDS
BUT I DON'T MEET HIS

I really need a hug
-e amount of money

I KEEP SEEING REPOSTS ON THE FRONT PAGE
AND ALL MY ORIGINAL, GENIUS MEMES NEVER MAKE IT PAST THE 5TH PAGE

when you have a really good meme
but you're out of submissions to the "fun" stream for a day

WHEN PLAYING A GAME AGAINST A COMPUTER
DOES ANYONE ELSE GET THE FEELING THAT THE COMPUTER THINKS YOU'RE STUPID?

I typed my symptoms into WebMD
It told me that I have network connectivity issues.

I JUST UPVOTED A MORONIC, UNFUNNY MEME
BECAUSE I COULDN'T HELP CORRECTING IT IN THE COMMENTS

I'M OUT OF MEME IDEAS, I'M NOT AS MOTIVATED TO MAKE MEMES AS I USED TO BE
AND THIS MEME DEFINITELY WON'T MAKE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE

WHEN YOU JUST BOUGHT A BUNCH OF STUFF AT KOHL‚ÄôS
AND FORGOT TO USE YOUR COUPONS

WHEN YOU POST A NUDE
AND SOMEONE GIVES IT A "THUMBS UP"

WHEN YOU SEE YOUR WAIFU DIE
"MY SENSE OF PURPOSE IS GONE."

OUT OF ALL THE IMAGES ON TV ABOUT FLORENCE
THE SNAKE SWIMMING IN THE FLOODWATERS BOTHERS ME THE MOST

PHONE DIES AT WORK
FORGOT USB CORD AT HOME

EASTER CANDY
GONE!

MY BUTLER OF FIVE YEARS
DOESN'T LIKE THE NEW MAID

WANTS TO COMMENT ON MEMES WITH MEMES, LIKE THE BIG BOYS DO
USES SEARCH ALL MEMES, FINDS THE RIGHT ONE, BUT CAN'T ATTACH IT.

I HAVE A HEADACHE
IT DOESN'T EVEN GO AWAY EVEN IF I LIE DOWN

HAVE YOU EVER HAD ONE OF THOSE WEEKS
THAT YOU COULDN'T THINK OF A MEME TO SUBMIT?

MY FATHER WAS NEVER SEXIST
HE ALWAYS BEAT ME AND MY BROTHERS EQUALLY

WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE MEME IS FUNNY
BUT YOU GET NO UPVOTES

WHEN YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO NORMALLY RESPOND TO SOMEONE ON THE INTERNET
SO YOU POST SONG LYRICS FROM THE LATE 70S

MY HUSBAND WANTS US TO GET LIFE INSURANCE
I THINK HE'S TRYING TO KILL ME

LAST SERIES OF 2019
HERE COME THE BLUES

WHEN SOMEONE REPOSTS YOUR MEME
BUT THEY GET MORE UPVOTES

WASNT ACTIVE ON IMGFLIP FOR A WHILE
THREE SUBMISSION GOT TURNED INTO TWO

I HAVEN'T BEEN USING ALL 3 OF MY SUBMISSIONS
SO IMGFLIP PUT ME IN 2 SUBMISSION TIME OUT

WHEN YOUR 12 AND YOUR MOM
TREATS LITTLE KIDS BETTER THAN SHE TREATS YOU

I NEED 7K
TO HIT 1/2 MILLION

I THOUGHT THE DRYER MADE MY CLOTHES SHRINK
TURNS OUT IT WAS THE REFRIGERATOR

WHEN OSSOFF LOSES
AND THERE'S NO ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO BLAME

I STAY UP LATE AT NIGHT
WORRYING ABOUT MY INSOMNIA

THE BULGE IN HIS PANTS
WASNT A WALLET

I WRECKED MY BMW LEAVING THE BAR LAST NIGHT
I SWERVED TO MISS A TREE BUT IT WAS JUST THE AIR FRESHENER HANGING FROM MY REAR VIEW MIRROR

WHATEVER WILL WE DO WHEN ALL THE FAMOUS ACTORS MOVE TO CANADA
WHO WILL BE LEFT TO TELL US WHAT TO DOOOOOOOO!

WHEN YOUR MOM FINDS OUT
IT'S TOO LATE TO HAVE AN ABORTION

CHRISTMAS IS ONLY FIVE DAYS AWAY
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT!!

WHEN YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE
THAT YOU ATE ALL THE DONUTS

I USED TO MAKE DECENT MEMES
BUT NOW I SUCK

MY DINNER TABLE IS SO BIG
TABLE CLOTH DOESN'T FIT

I RECENTLY BOUGHT A RANGE ROVER
AND NOW ALL THE WOMEN AT THE COUNTRY CLUB CHASTISE ME FOR USING IT AS THE OFF-ROAD VEHICLE IT WAS INTENDED TO BE.

EVERYTIME HALLOWEEN IS OVER, I THINK OF A GOOD MEME FOR HALLOWEEN
NOW I CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD CHRISTMAS MEME

IF YOU'RE TALKING LOUD ON YOUR PHONE IN PUBLIC
PLEASE PUT THE RECIPIENT ON SPEAKER, I NEED TO HEAR BOTH SIDES OF THE CONVERSATION

The doctor says I have the body of a 20-year-old
but I'm stretching it completely out of shape

I JUST REALIZED THAT I'M AT THE AGE WHERE
MY PARENTS CAN'T TEXT AND MY KIDS CAN'T WRITE

The first 5 days after a weekend
Are the hardest to get through

MY YOGA PANTS ARE IN THE WASHER
I HAVE TO WEAR REAL CLOTHES TOMORROW

IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY BILLS
I WOULD HAVE MONEY TO PAY MY BILLS

FORGOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT, EVERYONE SAYS IT CAN'T HAVE
BEEN THAT IMPORTANT IF I FORGOT IT, BUT IT WAS

WHEN YOUR TRYING TO ROAST SOMEONE OVER TEXT
AND YOU SPELL A WORD WRONG

USED MY FLASHLIGHT ON MY PHONE TO LOOK FOR MY KEYS THAT I DON'T NOTICE ARE IN MY HAND
SO I CAN OPEN MY CAR BECAUSE I THINK MY PHONE IS IN THERE

I ASKED MY HUSBAND ‚ÄúIF YOU COULD CHANGE ONE THING ABOUT ME, WHAT WOULD IT BE?‚Äù
HE TOLD ME HE'D LIKE TO CHANGE MY HUSBAND.

TODAY AT WORK WE DREW NAMES FOR NEXT MONTH'S "SECRET SANTA" AND THIS YEAR IT'S $35 AND UNDER
IS IT WRONG TO GIVE A COWORKER $35 IN LISTERINE?

THEN REALIZE IT‚ÄôS SUNDAY

I NEED TO POOP
BUT THE CLEANERS ARE HERE

I WAS GOING TO MAKE A MEME
BUT MY IDEA WAS ALREADY TAKEN

A MAN SAID SOMETHING HORRIBLE
HE SAID I WAS WRONG AND USED FACTS TO BACK IT UP

APPARENTLY YOU HAVE TO BE ACTUALLY FUNNY AND RELATABLE
TO GET MORE THAN 2 UPVOTES

I FORGOT MY CELL PHONE WHEN I WENT TO THE TOILET YESTERDAY
WE HAVE 245 TILES

I HAVE ONE SUBMISSION LEFT
BUT NO INSPIRATION

I WENT TO THE STATE FAIR
BUT ALL THE GAMES WERE UNFAIR

I AM ONE BAD RELATIONSHIP AWAY
FROM HAVING THIRTY CATS.

COFFEE MAKER IN THE KITCHEN AT WORK IS BROKEN

I SCREAMED AT MY HUSBAND "YOU'RE DRIVING ME TO MY GRAVE"
HE WENT AND WARMED UP THE CAR

I MET MY BOYFRIEND‚ÄôS DAD YESTERDAY
HE JUST SAT THERE BY HIS COMPUTER WITH A PINK MUG IN HIS HAND...SO SAD

MY HUSBAND JUST TOLD ME THAT BEFORE HE MARRIED ME, HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THERE WAS A WRONG WAY TO PUT MILK BACK IN THE FRIDGE

I FORGOT TO USE MY SUBMISSIONS YESTERDAY

NOW I CAN'T FIND ANY SHOES TO MATCH

I WANTED A PINK LAMBORGHINI
NOT A PINK PINK FERRARI

NO CHICK FIL A
IT'S SUNDAY

EVERYONE KEPT GIVING ME HUGS TODAY I FELT SO SPECIAL
THEN I COME HOME AND SEE IT'S HUG A DUMBASS DAY

IT'S TOO HOT OUTSIDE TO LEAVE THE AIR CONDITIONING
TO GO JUMP IN THE POOL

YOU ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE UNIQUE AND SPECIAL
UNTIL YOU TRY AND PICK A USER-NAME THAT HASN'T BEEN USED.

I ASKED MY SON: "MICHAEL AM I A GOOD MOTHER?"
HE SAID: "MY NAME IS JOHN."

I wanted to learn to drive a stick shift
But I couldn‚Äôt find a manual

WHEN THEY ASK U HOW U ARE AND U SAY THAT YOUR FINE

MY PARENTS KNOW THE EXACT DAY I WAS CONCEIVED
AND THEY LET ME KNOW

I TALKED TO JAKE FROM STATE FARM
AND HE SOUNDED HIDEOUS

There's too much week left
at the end of my money.

MY DEATH WILL PROBABLY BE CAUSED
BY BEING SARCASTIC AT THE WRONG TIME

WHOEVER STOLE MY ANTIDEPRESSANTS
I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY

WHEN A YOUNG TEENAGE GIRL FINDS OUT
THAT SHE SHOULD OF ENJOYED
HER LIFE AS A CHILD MORE

NOW I HAVE TO RATION THE SAUCE PER NUGGET LIKE IT'S WORLD WAR 2

COMPLAINED IN 1 ON 1 MEETING WITH BOSS ABOUT GENDER DEFAMATION AT WORK
ONLY WRITTEN UP FOR NEGATIVITY

TODAY IS A PICTURE DAY
AND I FORGOT MY MAKEUP

THERE ARE DAYS WHEN I FEEL
LIKE I OWN WATERFRONT PROPERTY ON $H1T CREEK.

APPARENTLY MY FIRE AND THEFT POLICY ONLY PAYS OUT
IF I AM BEING ROBBED WHILE THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE.

WHEN YOU START UPVOTING
YOUR OWN MEMES

WHEN YOU'RE NEW TO IMGFLIP
AND DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POINTS TO POST A MEME COMMENT

COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE OVEN IN MY NEW PLACE
TOOK ME TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO COOK SUPPER.

MY HUSBAND AND I WERE ARGUING SO HE SAID LET'S FLIP FOR IT
HEADS HE GETS TAIL AND TAILS HE GETS HEAD

WITH EVERY ONE OF MY MEMES THAT HITS THE FRONT PAGE
I CAN FEEL IMGFLIP GRIP MY SOUL A LITTLE TIGHTER

I ALWAYS GET THE WORDS EXOTIC AND EROTIC MIXED UP
AND I JUST HAD
THE WEIRDEST CONVERSATION AT THE LOCAL PET STORE

instead of spending 30 seconds washing it by hand

BACON WEEK
ISN'T AS POPULAR AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

TOO TIRED TO GET UP AND EAT

I QUIT DRINKING SUGARY SOFT DRINKS LAST WEEK
IT'S "SODA PRESSING"

THERE‚ÄôS SOMETHING WEIRD
GOING ON WITH IMGFLIP

I took the batteries out of the carbon monoxide detector
The loud beeping was giving me a headache and making me feel sick and dizzy

I ATE MY LUNCH ON MY FIRST BREAK
NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO EAT ON MY LUNCH BREAK

GETS VAPORIZED

I'VE JUST LOOKED THROUGH ALL OF MY IMAGES
AND DELETED OVER 40% OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE

I HAVE TO PISS
BUT THE BED HOLDS ME DOWN WITH IT'S COMFORT.

STAYING WITH RELATIVES
THEY DON'T KNOW THEIR WIFI PASSWORD

YOU KNOW YOU'RE UGLY WHEN IT COMES TO A GROUP PICTURE
AND THEY GIVE YOU THE CAMERA

THIS PERSON POSTED ANONYMOUS MEMES
I CANNOT TROLL THEM EFFECTIVELY. I AM SO DEPRESSED. (EAT IT!) STICK YOUR UPVOTES IN YOUR TAILPIPES.

HERE WE GO AGAIN
CELEBRITIES ARE NOW TRYING TO TELL THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE HOW TO VOTE

I SUBMITTED MY MEMES ON TIME
BUT I STILL HAVE 3 ALT ACCOUNTS TO SUBMIT MEMES FROM!

WHEN YOU CLICK THE CORRECT ANSWER
BUT IT'S A CHOOSE ALL THAT APPLY

WHEN YOU EAT A SNICKERS
AND IT DOES NOTHING FOR YOU

BEING NAUGHTY WHEN
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IS BEST

ISN'T IT CRAZY HOW YOU THINK YOUR MEMES ARE GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD AND SOMETIMES AWESOME
BUT PRETTY MUCH NO ONE ELSE ON IMGFLIP THINKS THE SAME?

WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD MEME BUT SPEND SO MUCH TIME SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT IMAGE
THAT YOU FORGET THE MEME

When you thought you would have snacks for a week
But you ate them all in two days

I WAS GOING TO MAKE A MEME
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL A CERTAIN WORD

DECIDED TO BUY A HOLE IN THE GROUND FROM IKIA
DID NOT REALISE I HAD TO DIG IT MYSELF

AND IT DIES AND IT TAKES TOO LONG TO TURN ON

ALL THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY
ARE INSANE.

I WORK AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK
AND I'M SO IMMUNE TO THE SOUND OF SCREAMING THAT I DON'T THINK I'D NOTICE IF SOMEONE WAS ACTUALLY IN TROUBLE

My kids are like coffee beans
They‚Äôre always getting grounded

I LIKE 7 RADIO STATIONS
BUT I ONLY HAVE 6 PRESETS

WHEN YOU FIND GOOD MEMES UNDER LATEST SUBMISSIONS
BUT THE BAD ONES RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE

I BOUGHT A POOL TABLE TODAY
I HAD TO WAIT AGES IN THE QUEUE

WENT TO BLACK ANGUS TO EAT DINNER, GOT THERE AND THE "G" WAS MISSING ON THE SIGN
DECIDED TO GO TO OUTBACK INSTEAD

SOME CLERK MUST HAVE DROPPED MY PACKAGE OF OREOS
I CAN'T TWIST THEM OFF TO EAT IN INDIVIDUAL LAYERS WITHOUT THEM BREAKING APART

WHEN YOUR SCHOOL
BLOCKED IMGFLIP

I WANTED TO TELL YOU HOW I FELT
BUT I COULDN'T FIND THE RIGHT MEME

KEEP LOOKING AT ONE OF THE FUNNIEST USERS ON HERE
ALL OF HIS LATEST MEMES HAVE JUST BEEN A SINGLE NUMBER

I WAS READING A PAPER MAGAZINE AND SAW AN AD
I CLICKED ON IT

I FORGOT TO USE MY SUBMISSIONS YESTERDAY
I'LL NEVER GET BACK UP TO 3 A DAY....

I really need to get in shape
If I were murdered today, my chalk outline would be a circle

WE HAVE END OF THE YEAR EXAMS
THIS WEEK

COMPANY CAME OVER
AND I HAD TO PUT ON PANTIES

HAS THOSE LITTLE CLICKY SOUNDS
WHEN HE TEXTS

I PUSHED TOO HARD ON MY EARDRUM WITH A Q-TIP
AND RESET MY BRAIN BACK TO THE FACTORY DEFAULTS.

I'VE NEVER BEEN
ASSUALTED OR HARASSED AT WORK!

BEING A PARENT AT CHRISTMAS IS JUST LIKE A JOB
YOU WORK YOUR BUTT OFF AND A FAT GUY IN A SUIT GETS ALL THE CREDIT

WHEN YOU REPEATEDLY TELL YOUR TEAM TO CHECK THEIR EMAILS
AND THEY STILL DON'T

OH MY. IT'S WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S
ALL OVER AGAIN

THANK YOU ALL
FOR 10,000 POINTS!

WHEN YOU FORGET TO POST TO IMGFLIP FOR A FEW MONTHS
AND YOU GET BACK AND ONLY HAVE 1 NOTIF AND ITS A HATE COMMENT

CONTRACTS A FEVER, GETS BETTER
GETS SICK AGAIN NOT EVEN A WHOLE WEEK LATER

ASIANS BE LIKE
I GOT A B+ MY MOM IS GONNA F**K ME UP

I ASKED SIRI WHY I WAS STILL SINGLE
SIRI ACTIVATED THE FRONT CAMERA.

THE IN ROOM COFFEE MAKER IN MY HOTEL ROOM WAS BROKEN
I HAD TO GET DRESSED AND GO DOWNSTAIRS TO GET FREE COFFEE.

DINOSAURS ARE LIKE MY DAD
I NEVER GOT THE SEE EITHER OF THEM AND THEY ARE NOW EXTINCT

WHEN YOU MAKE A REALLY CLEVER/FUNNY MEME
AND IT DOESN'T RECEIVE ANY COMMENTS

AS IF WOMEN DON'T FIND MEN
EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE. SOME PROBABLY LIE ABOUT THAT

DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE DATING THOSE
WITH TONS OF EVIDENCE OF BEING BABY RAPISTS, THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT IT?!

PEOPLE ARE FAR LESS JUDGMENTAL WHEN YOU SAY YOU HAD AN "AVOCADO SALAD"
instead of saying you ate a bowl of guacamole.

MY HUSBAND DOES EVERYTHING I ASK
BUT I HAVE TO ASK

I KEEP FORGETTING
TO MAKE A.......

ISN'T SAD THAT IF YOU WALK AROUND HAPPY AND SMILING
PEOPLE THINK YOUR AN IDIOT

I TYPED AMEN ON FACEBOOK
AND GOD DIDNT GIVE ME $1,000,000 IN AN HOUR LIKE HE PROMISED

I HAD TO GO
TO WORK TODAY

SOME MEMES MAKE ME LAUGH SO HARD
TEARS RUN DOWN MY LEGS

I MADE THIS COMMENT ON YOUR POPULAR MEME
TOO LATE FOR IT TO BE RELEVANT

MY EMPLOYER BUSTED ME AT MY COMPUTER WORKSTATION USING IMGFLIP AND THEN HE ASKED HOW OFTEN I HAVE WASTED VALUABLE COMPANY TIME ON THE SITE
I JUST SENT HIM A HILLARY CLINTON MEME THAT SAID " I DO NOT RECALL"

BEING IN MY KIDS TEA PARTY
IS LIKE BEING HELD HOSTAGE

When their Facebook statuses are so deep
with crap and clich√©s.

I CAN'T FIND MY PHONE CHARGER
1ST WORLD PROBLEM

MY COMMENTS GET MORE VIEWS
THAN MY MEMES

I LOGGED ON AFTER 5 DAYS
MY SCORE IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS LAST MONTH

WHEN YOU LOVE A SHOW ON A PLATFORM YOU DON'T HAVE
BUT NO ONE PIRATED THE SHOW ONTO YOUTUBE YET

I DREAMED A BEAR WAS TRYING TO EAT ME
AND MY HUSBAND JUST CARRIED ON PLAYING CARDS WITH A TELETUBBY.

WHY CAN'T MY CAT
EVER BRING ME A MERCEDES

LAST YEAR I ASKED SANTA FOR A SLIM BODY AND A FAT BANK ACCOUNT
I HOPE HE DOESN'T GET THEM BACKWARDS AGAIN THIS YEAR

AFTER WASHING THE MIXING BOWL AND SHAKING THE WATER OFF OF IT
THE DARNED THING SLIPPED FROM MY HAND RIGHT BACK INTO THE SOAPY WATER

WHEN YOU FORGET YOUR FACEBOOK PASSWORD
AND ALL YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT IS LINKED WITH IT

LOST MY CAR KEY BETWEEN THE SEATS
DRIVING TO WORK THIS MORNING

WHEN YOU WANT TO RELEASE THAT FEMALE ENERGY
COMPLETELY SOBER

MY WIFI IS OUT
AND I CAN NOT MAKE MEMES

NOT KNOWING THERE WAS AN ASSIGNMENT
AND GOING INTO CLASS

THIS MORNING I WOKE UP TO THE UNMISTAKABLE SCENT OF PIGS IN A BLANKET
THAT' WHAT I GET FOR LETTING MY RELATIVES STAY FOR THE HOLLIDAYS

I PEELED MY HANGNAIL
NOW MY FINGER HURTS A LOT

I DON'T KNOW WHY
BUT I AM DERPRESSED

SOMEONE REPLIED TO MY COMMENT
WITHOUT UPVOTING IT

WHEN YOU REALIZE COOLERMOMMY

THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN FINDING A SPIDER
IS LOSING IT AGAIN

I HAVE NOBODY TO LOVE
MY VALENTINES DAY WILL BE LONELY

I DON'T KNOW WHAT PRESCRIPTION'S SIDE EFFECTS I COULD MOST TOLERATE:

I WANTED TO RETURN THIS SHIRT I GOT FOR CHRISTMAS BECAUSE IT IS TOO BIG AND IT'S UGLY
BUT I ATE SO MUCH IT FITS NOW

I AM SO ADDICTED TO DRAMA
I TROLL MY OWN MEMES

GOT MY KID A PLAYSTATION FOR CHRISTMAS
SAID HE LIKED XBOX MORE

IT'S 10:30 ON A SATURDAY NIGHT AND I AM HEADED TO BED
I OFFICIALLY HAVE NO SOCIAL LIFE

I TOLD HIM TO GIVE A MINUTE I WAS APPLYING MY MAKEUP
HE TOLD MAKEUP IS ANOTHER WORD FOR LYING

SOME SAD NEWS THIS MORNING. PAUL TOOK AN OVERDOSE OF VIAGRA

BUT REALIZE YOUR CHARGER IS IN THE OTHER ROOM

TRIED TO USE MY WHITE PRIVILEGE CARD TO GET OUT OF PAYING MY TAXES
NOW THE IRS IS AUDITING ME.

IMGFLIP BUMPED ME
DOWN TO TWO SUBMISSIONS

THEY SAY THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN GENIUS AND CRAZY
BUT I CAN'T SEE IT

I OPENED THE BATHROOM DOOR AND ASKED MY HUSBAND IF I LOOKED FAT IN THIS
HE SAID WELL SWEETHEART IT IS A SMALL BATHROOM

LOCALS COULDNT UNDERSTAND ME
TALKING SLOWER DIDN'T HELP

TRIED CHEWING 1/2 A PACK OF CAREFREE GUM
STILL WORRIED

I CALLED MY PHONE TO LOCATE IT
BUT I HAD SET THE RINGER OFF

I HAVE NOTHING TO DO
BUT MAKE MEMES

I POSTED A COMENT AND FELT SO GRATE ABOUT IT
UNTIL THE GRAMMAR NAZI POINTED OUT MY MISSPELLINGS

I GOT EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL ON PAJAMA DAY
NOT MY FAULT I SLEEP NAKED

I START WORRYING FOR AMERICA
WHEN I SEE SIGNS ADVERTISING "GLUTEN FREE HAIRCUTS"

WE BOOKED A ROOM FACING THE OCEAN AT THE HOTEL
BUT I COULDN'T HEAR THE WAVES--ALL I COULD HEAR WAS MY HUSBAND SNORING

THE CUTEST LITTLE GIRLS CAME TO MY DOOR YESTERDAY SELLING GIRLS SCOUT COOKIES
TODAY MY CO-WORKER IS BRAGGING ABOUT HOW HER HUSBAND SOLD 72 BOXES FOR HIS DAUGHTER AT WORK

I KEEP MAKING MEMES AND REALIZING LATER
THAT A MINOR CHANGE WOULD MAKE IT SO MUCH BETTER

My daughter said she scored 100 for 3 papers
Turns out it was hundred if u added the scores up

RED
I SAID RED WINE NOT WHITE

MISTAKENLY THOUGHT SWEET TARTS CHEWS WERE LAFFY TAFFY IN CANDY BOWL AT WORK
MILDLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND NO JOKES ON THE WRAPPER

MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN WISHING EVERYONE A HAPPY NEW YEAR FOR THE PAST WEEK
HE SUFFERS FROM PREMATURE CONGRATULATIONS

THAT MOMENT WHEN THERE ARE 500 VIEWS
BUT ONLY 15 UPVOTES

BEING CREMATED
MY LAST HOPE FOR A HOT, SMOKING BODY

People want the blessings of God
but want to blame Him for the bad things that happen to them.

I MADE MY LAST SUBMISSION ON MIDNIGHT
I CREATED A MEME THIS MORNING SO I HAVE TO WILL TILL MIDNIGHT TO GET SUBMISSIONS

I WENT ON A DIET
AND GAINED THREE POUNDS.

OH NO
NO ONE LIKED MY WEAK-ASS UR MOM GAY JOKE

I WAS LOOKING AT MY OLDER MEMES AN HAVE NO CLUE WHO I WAS TALKING TO
BECAUSE HALF OF THE USERS DELETED THEIR ACCOUNTS

I WANTED TO MAKE A RAGE COMIC
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE FACES WERE NAMED

HOURS WORTH OF HOMEWORK FINALLY DONE
LEAVES IT ON THE KITCHEN TABLE

I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT MAKING MEMES AT 1:00 AM
NOW ITS 5:30 PM AND I CAN'T SUBMIT MY THREE NEW MEMES

WHEN YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN A USER FOR OVER TWO YEARS AND HAVE A DECENT AMOUNT OF POINTS
BUT YOU STILL ONLY GET TWO SUBMISSIONS A DAY

I ALWAYS DREAMED OF BEING A WORLD-CLASS JUGGLER
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE BALLS.

MY BON JOVI SATNAV

WHEN YOU FINISH A GROUP ASSIGNMENT ON YOUR OWN
BUT YOUR FRIEND TOOK THE CREDIT AND NOT YOU

MY GRANDMA DIED AND
MY BROTHER GOT THE CASH

WHEN YOU LOOK AT IMGFLIP
AND ALL THE MEMES ARE ABOUT TIDE PODS AND POLITICS

I ACCIDENTALLY MADE A WRONG TURN AND ENDED UP ON THE HIGHWAY
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO BAD EXCEPT THE NEXT CLOSEST EXIT WAS TEN MILES AWAY

I WANTED TO BUY A BOOK ABOUT HAGGLING
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

WHEN YOU REALIZE PUBLIC SCHOOL IS A LOT LIKE PRISON
AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO HOMESCHOOL YOUR KIDS.

I TOLD HIM IT WAS ME OR THE CAR
IT WAS THE LONGEST BURNOUT IVE EVER SEEN

HE SAYS I LACK IMAGINATION
I CAN'T THINK OF WHAT THAT HE MEANS BY THAT

I TOLD MYSELF I WOULDN‚ÄôT CRY AT THE END OF BLACK HAWK DOWN
I DID

Calories: Tiny creatures that live in your closet
and sew your clothes a little bit tighter every night!

WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF MEME SUBMISSIONS IN FUN
SO YOU HAVE TO POST YOUR KITTEN MEME IN THE CATS TAB

WHEN YOUR PROUD OF YOU'RE MEME
BUT PEOPLE ONLY CARE ABOUT YOU NOT KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR AND YOU'RE

WHAT IF THERE ARE NO MICROWAVE OVENS
IN MY NEXT LIFE

I MADE A REALLY FUNY MEME
BUT NOBODY ELSE WATCHED,DID OR HEARD WHAT I DID,SO NOBODY GETS IT

WE HAD TWINS
HE REJECTS THE SECOND ONE, CALLING IT A REPOST.

1-800-555-MEME

JOINED IMGFLIP 2¬Ω YEARS AGO JUST TO MAKE A GIF FOR CHAT

WHEN ITS FRYDAY
BUT YOU HAVE A SCIENCE FAIR ON SATERDAY

HE DIED DOING WHAT HE LOVED
CHECKING HIS IMGFLIP NOTIFICATIONS WHILE DRIVING

MY COMPANY HASN'T CLEANED THE WORK GYM WINDOWS IN A WHILE
SO IT'S HARDER THAN USUAL TO CHECK OUT ATTRACTIVE WOMEN WALKING BY OUTSIDE

I DISCOVERED WOODS OF YPRES
AFTER 12/22/11

IT WOULD BE NICE IF IN ORDER TO VOTE
A PERSON HAD TO FIRST WORK AND PAY TAXES AND BILLS

I YELLED AT MY HUSBAND I DO NOT "NAG" YOU ALL THE TIME
HE SAID OKAY THEN YOU'RE JUST "VERBALLY REPETITIVE"

THIS ISN'T DEMOCRACY
WHY IS THE PRESIDENT SOMEONE I DIDN'T VOTE FOR?

I'M HUNGRY
BUT I JUST BRUSHED MY TEETH

RAN OUT OF CHEETOS
HAVE TO GO TO THE STORE

MY HUSBAND'S SHOWERS

MY HUSBAND TAKES A PAIN KILLER

ALCOHOL = POISON
HOW MANY LIVES HAVE I SEEN DESTROYED BY PEOPLE POISONING THEMSELVES SO MUCH TO THE POINT WHERE IT KILLS SO MANY BRAIN CELLS AND THEY HARDLY HAVE CONTROL OVER THEMSELVES ANYMORE

I JUST STEPPED ON A CHEERIO WHILE WALKING IN THE KITCHEN
CLEARLY, THE DOG IS NOT DOING HIS PART OF THE CHORES AROUND HERE

I JUST PLAYED A KIDS SONG I LOVE
AND MY MOTHER AND BROTHER CAME IN ON ME AND RECORDED EVERY SECOND OF ME SINGING ALONG TO IT

My son became a famous painter
I Can't believe I threw away a billion dollars worth of refrigerator art work

WITH THE MEME WARS GOING ON EACH WEEK
I'M SCARED TO EVEN MAKE A MEME

I HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE IMG FLIP

I SPENT 10 MIN LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT TEMPLATE FOR A REPLY
THEN JUST TYPED ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù

WHEN YOU POST A MEME AND I GIVES YOU AN IDEA
BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO POST IT, IT TELLS YOU TO WAIT TILL TOMORROW

EVERYTIME THE MICROWAVE STARTS
I GET "I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY" STUCK IN MY HEAD

I BROKE A MIRROR THE OTHER DAY, WHICH IS SEVEN YEARS BAD LUCK
MY LAWYER SAYS HE CAN GET ME FIVE

WHEN IT'S VALENTINES DAY

FRIEND WANTS TO COME

HELLO DARKNESS MY OLD FRIEND
IVE COME TO SPEAK WHIT YOU AGAIN

I HATE MY NEW HAIRCUT
I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO WALMART AGAIN

MY COMMENTS

COUNTRY, WHERE I CAN EAT FOR 73 CENTS A DAY.

I WANT TO READ ALL THESE MEME COMMENTS
BUT IM TWO DAYS BEHIND AND IT WILL DRIVE ME INSANE TO TRY AND READ THEM ALL

I TRIED TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT
BUT THE LITTLE VOICES IN MY HEAD KEEP TELLING ME HOW DEPRESSED THEY ARE GETTING

I WISH I COULD TRUST
THE WOMAN THAT BROKE THE GLASS CEILING

My parents gave me a Nokia as my first cell phone
They said I can have a new one once my old phone breaks

I HAVE TO GET UP
AND GO TO WORK IN FIVE MINUTES

I CAN'T THINK OF ANY MEMES
FOR A WEBSITE ON THE INTERNET FOR POINTS ON THAT WEBSITE ON THE INTERNET THAT LITERALLY HAS NO VALUE OR MEANING

SIX DAYS A WEEK

I USED TO LAUGH AT MY BOYFRIEND'S JOKES
NOW I JUST HATE THEM

WHEN YOU THINK OF A MEME
BUT THE MEME YOU THINK OF HAS WAY TOO MANY WORDS AND YOU CAN'T POST IT BECAUSE THE HIGH WORD COUNT MAKES THE TEXT IN THE MEME HARDER TO READ AND DEGRADES THE MEME QUALITY IN GENERAL

AT THIS POINT, I'M JUST DIGGING A HOLE, BUILDING A BUNKER
FATTENING THE NEIGHBORS AND WAITING FOR THE ZOMBIES

I WOKE UP AND THOUGHT IT WAS FRIDAY
BUT ITS MONDAY

I DIDN'T CHECK IMGFLIP FOR TWO DAYS
NOW PEOPLE THINK I'M A TROLL BECAUSE I DIDN'T UPVOTE THEIR COMMENTS ON MY MEME

WHEN AMAZON SHIPS ITEMS
IN SEPARATE BOXES

HELLO DARKNESS SMILED FRIEND
I COME TO SEE YOU ONCE A AGAIN

THEY ASKED ME WHAT QUALIFICATIONS I HAD FOR THIS JOB
APPARENTLY BEING ABLE TO TWERK 5 MINUTES STRAIGHT WASN'T WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR

When you post a meme in the meme channel of a meme server
But that type of meme is against the memes - I mean rules

I CAN'T MAKE MY KIDS

I TOLD HIM HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GET ANYTHING FOR ME FOR VALENTINE'S DAY
& HE BELIEVED ME

MY MEMES AREN'T GETTING UPVOTED
I NEED A SAFE SPACE....

AFTER A YEAR OF MARRIAGE
THE ONLY ONE EXCITED TO SEE ME WHEN I WALK THROUGH THE DOOR IS THE DOG

You say you love me, now I'm scared

I'm so sick
Of these useless doctor's appointments

JUST REMEMBERED THAT MY ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY
ON THIS WEBSITE HAS PASSED, AND I MISSED IT COMPLETELY.

I SEE ONE OF THE FUNNIEST AND WITTIEST COMMENTS... I HIT LIKE ONLY TO BE MOCKED BY IMGFLIP
"YOU CAN'T VOTE ON YOUR OWN COMMENTS SILLY!"

MFW
IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS AND IM BACK

UGLY DYKES INFORMING THE WORLD ON HOW WOMEN WANT TO BE TREATED

BECAUSE YOU SPENT ALL WEEKEND WATCHING TV

THEY WERE OUT OF REGULAR MILK AT THE GROCERY STORE
SO I HAD TO BUY ORGANIC

THE GUY AT THE CARNIVAL GUESSED MY WEIGHT

I VOTED TRUMP
AND THEN HILLARY FANS STARTED BURNING DOWN MY HOUSE

I EXAMINED MY CUTICLES AND REALIZED

I HAVE AN ADDITCTION
TO IMGFLIP

VOTING FOR TRUMP OR HILLARY
IS LIKE CHOOSING BETWEEN DRINKING TOILET WATER OR SEWER WATER

MY FACE WHEN I SAW
THAT IT WAS TRUMP 82% AND HILLARY 18%

WHEN I JUMP TO MY PROFILE AFTER COMMENTING ON A POST, AND SEE THAT I HAVE A NEW NOTIFICATION
THEN CLICK THE NOTIFICATION, TO BE REMINDED THAT I JUST REPLIED TO ONE OF MY OWN COMMENTS

IT'S SO QUIET
THE ONLY PEOPLE DRIVING AROUND ARE THE SPECIALS

FUN GAMES ARE TOO EASY
HARD GAMES AREN'T FUN

NO MATTER HOW WELL EVERYTHING IS GOING
MY WHOLE DAY GETS RUINED WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T USE THEIR TURN SIGNALS

PEOPLE ON IMGFLIP ARE QUICKER TO REPLY TO ME
THAN MY FRIENDS WHEN I TEXT THEM

ONE OF THE WORST FEELINGS IS TO LOVE
WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL THE SAME

WHEN ITS BEEN OVER 2 MINUTES
AND HE HASNT TEXTED YOU BACK

TURN THE CLOCKS BACK THEY SAID, YOU'LL HAVE MORE SLEEP THEY SAID
NOT WITH FOUR CATS YOU DON'T

HE SHOWED ME HIS LENNY
IT WAS HUGE

WHEN U REALIZE
U SPENT ALL UR $ ON MCDONALD'S

AND THE INK RAN OUT

AFTER YEARS OF MAKING MEMES

BUT THEN I DO THE MATH IN MY HEAD AND FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH I HAD TO SPEND TO SAVE THAT MUCH IN THE FIRST PLACE

TRIED TO MAKE A CRAFT I SAW ON PINTREST
AND SOMEHOW I GLUED MY HAND TO MY HEAD...

IF ONLY EVERYTHING WAS AS EASY
AS SCREWING THINGS UP

I SURE HOPE IF I'M EVER MURDERED IT'S BY A RED, WHITE, AND BLUE AMERICAN
I DON'T THINK I COULD GO ON LIVING IF IT WAS A ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

THE EAGLES JUST GOT THEIR RING
I'M STILL WAITING ON MINE

THESE DAYS THERE ARE NO ORIGINAL MEMES
EVERYTHING IS A REPOST

WHEN YOUR BODY IS DRIPPING SWEAT
AND YOUR CRUSH TOUCHES YOU AND GIVES YOU A NASTY LOOK

MY FACE WHEN MY AMAZING MEME
DOESN'T MAKE THE FRONT PAGE

AT NIGHT: IT‚ÄôS TOO HOT TO SLEEP
IN THE MORNING: IT‚ÄôS TOO COLD TO GET UP

I HAVE FAST WI-FI, A HUGE INHERITANCE AND MY HAND CAN FIT RIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINGLES TIN
BUT NOW I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

I GOT DRUNK AND ASKED MY MOM IF SHE WAS A VIRGIN
SHE SAID "UNFORTUNATELY, NO."

ONCE I FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, I MAY ACTUALLY ENJOY IT

I SAID IT WAS THE TIDDEY OR ME
THE NOISE FROM HIS HARLEY WAS DEAFENING

THE WATER AT MY SCHOOL
IS WARM

HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET INTO MY PANTS
HE ONLY WANTED TO WEAR THEM.

I WAKE UP MUCH EARLIER THIS MORNING
AND I'M STILL LATE FOR WORK

WHEN YOU GO ON A MATCHMAKING WEBSITE
AND THEY MATCH YOU WITH ONE OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S EXES.

I INTRODUCE MY BOYFRIEND TO MY FRIENDS AS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE
HE INTRODUCES ME TO HIS FRIENDS AS HIS ROOMMATE

WHEN YOU SIGN INTO IMGFILP

AND THEN ACCIDENTALLY DELETE IT

O.M.G WHERE HAS THE WEEKEND GONE
WORK TOMORROW. I HATE MONDAYS

I'M A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT AND A LONGTIME FOX NEWS HATER

I SPIT MY GUM OUT THE WINDOW WHILE DRIVING
NOW IT'S STUCK ON THE SIDE OF MY CAR

HOLIDAY BREAK IS OVER
I HAVE TO WORK 5 DAYS PER WEEK

I HAVEN'T BEEN ON IMGFLIP IN SO LONG
THE MEMES FROM THE WEEKS THAT I MISSED ARE STARTING TO GET OLD

WHEN YOU THINK YOU ONLY NEED TO PEE SO YOU DON'T BRING YOUR PHONE
BUT THEN YOU NEED TO POOP

WHY IS IT THAT I WILL PISS MYSELF WHEN I LAUGH, COUGH, OR SNEEZE WHILE SITTING ON THE COUCH OR STANDING
BUT THEN DO ALL THOSE THINGS WHILE ON THE TOILET, AND NOTHING HAPPENS?

THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU REALIZE
HOW MUCH THE INTERNET HAS REALLY CORRUPTED YOU

WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU COULD HAVE
SAVED EVERY MEME YOU HAVE MADE

I MADE TWO MEMES
THEY‚ÄôRE STILL ONLY ‚ÄúSUBMITTED‚Äù

WHEN YOU WANT TO MOVE TO A FIRST WORLD COUNTRY
AND YOU REALIZE YOU'RE ALREADY IN ONE

SO I TOLD HER SHE WAS WALMART SEXY

MY TV BROKE - NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO ENTERTAIN ME
EXCEPT MY PHONE, MY TABLET, MY KINDLE, AND MY DESKTOP COMPUTER

UPGRADED
HAD TO DOWNSIZE ADAPTOR

But raising the minimum

I USED TO WORK AT A FIRE HYDRANT FACTORY
YOU COULDN'T PARK ANYWHERE NEAR THE PLACE AND IT SMELLED LIKE DOG PEE

DRANK MY TEARS

FORGOT IT WAS GOOD FRIDAY

BEFORE I FINALLY REALIZED COLLEGE LIBERAL IS A GUY.

CNN ACCUSED ME OF BEING
AN ALIEN TERRORIST

REBUKES COMIC BOOK INDUSTRY FOR THE WAY THEY DRAW SUPERHEROINE COSTUMES
ISN'T BOTHERED BY THE BEHAVIOR OF CELEBRITIES ENDORSING HILLARY CLINTON

FIRST IT WAS TOO NOISY
NOW IT IS TOO QUIET

ONCE DATED A GUY WITH A LAZY EYE
EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL SHE REALIZED HE WAS SEEING SOMEONE ELSE

HOLLYWOOD WILL ONLY KEEP CASTING ME IF I STAY IN SHAPE
THIS MEANS MEN WILL STILL WANT TO SMASH ME, I'LL ADD YEARS TO MY LIFE AND RAKE IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

I DECIDED TO BECOME A FEMINIST
BUT MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T LET ME

TRIED TO BREAK INTO ACTING
GOT IN AN INFOMERCIAL

THAT MOMENT
YOU HEARD THERE'S RADIO STATION PLAYING "BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE"

WHEN YOU ARE HAVING A PEACFUL TIME
AND THE ONE ANOYYING FRIEND KNOCKS ON YOUR DOOR

MY IPHONE4 IS SO OUTDATED
I CAN'T EVEN DOWNLOAD YOUTUBE APP

WHEN CHRISTMAS IS A DAY EARLY
AND YOU GOT NO ONE STUFF YET

IF GOD HAD WANTED ME THIN
WHY DID HE INVENT ICE CREAM?

WATCH ANIME WHILE WORKING
CAN'T DO THAT

MADE A MEME ALMOST A YEAR AGO
NO ONE COMMENTED

THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU MAKE A SPELLING MISTAKE ON A MEME
AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT

FORGETS A MEME
SOMEONE ELSE MADE IT AND GOT IT TO THE FRONT PAGE

I SHOUTED "LET'S BE SWINGERS!" AT A BASEBALL GAME
WHILE SITTING WITH MY MARRIED FRIENDS.

YESTERDAY I HAD 3 SUBMISSIONS
TODAY I HAVE TWO

MY HUSBAND
BOUGHT A FORD

I CREATED A MEME
BUT IMGFLIP WON'T FEATURE IT

I'M MORE AFRAID OF THINGS
THAN MY CHILDREN

SENT HUSBAND TO BUY TP
CAME BACK WITH CHEAP 1-PLY

I CAN NO LONGER MAKE MEMES
ABOUT THE "UPCOMING ELECTION"

*BOYFRIEND IN THE BACK*
DUDE MY JAPANESE GIRLFRIEND WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND WE BROKE UP UNTIL I DROPPED TWO BOMBS ON HER

LOST MY WATCH AT A BAR TODAY. FOUND SOMEONE STANDING ON IT SHOUTING "HARAMBE WAS JUST A GORILLA!"
I BROKE HIS NOSE. NO ONE SAYS HARAMBE WAS JUST A GORILLA.
NOT ON MY WATCH.

IF THEIR WERE MORE WOMEN SCIENTISTS AND INVENTORS
WE WOULD HAVE SELF CLEANING HOUSES, ROBOTIC BABY SITTERS, AND NON-CALORIC CHEESCAKE

MADE ONE TINY MISTAKE
NOW MY PHARMACIST WRITES "TO BE TAKEN ORALLY" ON EVERYTHING.

IN SEARCH OF THE MOST UPVOTED MEME IN IMGFLIP HISTORY
NOT EVEN WIKIPEDIA COULD HELP

I'M ONE CENT AWAY FROM BUYING MY LIPSTICK
IM GOING TO DIE

EPIC B...BANNED
MMEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!

THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU REALIZE
YOUR FRENCH FRIES ARE NOW ALL OVER THE FLOOR

HAVE 3 COMPUTER MONITORS AT WORK
UNSURE WHAT TO PUT ON EACH

WHEN THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT IT'LL ONLY HURT A LITTLE
OOH BOY JUST WAIT UNTIL IT KICKS IN

IN LIKE A LION
OUT LIKE A LION

MY FINGERNAILS CAN'T PEEL
THE ORANGE

WHEN THE BAG OF CHIPS BUST
ON THE WRONG END

I NEED TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING
BUT ALL OF MY SPANDEX IS IN THE WASH

THE ROMAN SALUTE IS MY FAVORITE SALUTE EVER
WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOMETHING AS INFAMOUS AS NAZISM?

HERE I SIT BROKEN HEARTED
TRIED TO SHIT BUT ONLY FARTED

PEOPLE TELL ME I AM
TO FAT

EVERYONE PRAISES COUPLES WHO NEVER SPENT A DAY APART FROM ONE ANOTHER
I APPLAUD COUPLES WHO HAVE TO PART, BUT STAY TOGETHER, WHATEVER

I WAS DAY DREAMING
IT WAS NIGHT

I HAVE TO PICK UP MY KIDS FROM SOCCER, TAEKWONDO AND GET GROCERIES
I HAD TO SEND 3 DIFFERENT UBERS

MY MAN DOESN‚ÄôT HIT LIKE ON ANY OF MY SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ANY MORE
#WHENYOUKNOWITSOVER

I JUST REALIZED THAT TOP MEMERS GET MORE POINTS AND POPULARITY IN A WEEK
THAN I'VE GOTTEN EVER

YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY YOUR FINE
WHEN YOU AREN'T FINE!!

WHEN I GET A UPVOTE ON IMGFLIP
"THEY DO CARE..."

I HAVE GOALS
BUT I'M TOO LAZY TO GET OUT OF BED, WHEN I HAVE FREE TIME

I CUT MYSELF TODAY ACCIDENTALLY WHILE SHAVING
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A GIRL...

I FELL INTO THE TOILET AT A SCHOOL'S PUBLIC RESTROOM ONCE
BECAUSE THE JANITOR LEFT THE SEATS UP AFTER HE CLEANED THE TOILETS

WHEN PEWDS SAYS HES LEAVING FOR 2 WEEKS
AND U THOUGHT HE MEANT FOREVER

NEXT TIME THEY MAKE ME CHOP A WHOLE BAG OF ONIONS AT WORK
I SWEAR I'M GOING TO CRY

I MADE A REALLY CLEVER MEME TAKING THE PISS
NOBODY CARED

WHEN YOU FIND OUT
THAT ALL THE FOOD YOU ATE GAVE YOU THE SHITS

WORKED AS A INTERN IN THE SENATE ONE SUMMER
WHY WASN'T I SEXUALLY HARASSED !

I TOLD HIM I LOOK SO OLD AND HE ANSWERED
BUT YOUR EYES ARE STILL WORKING

EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THEIR KIDS
AND I'M STILL TRYING TO FIND A GIRLFRIEND

WHEN YOUR MEME GETS 500 VIEWS
BUT ONLY 3 LIKES

WHEN YOU REMEMBER
YOUR SON IS GAY

HE TOLD ME THAT MEN ONLY HAVE TWO EMOTIONS
HORNY AND HUNGRY,
SO IF I DONT SEE AN ERECTION I SHOULD MAKE HIM A SANDWICH

SPENDS MONEY ON BUYING FOOD
SPEND'S OTHER MONEY ON LOSING WEIGHT

THAT LOOK LIKE MONICA LEWINSKI

I HAVE NO IDEAS
FOR MEMES

MY KNEES SOUND LIKE
A CONCRETE MIXER

IF A MAN TRULY LOVES YOU
HE WON‚ÄôT ASK YOU TO DO DISGUSTING THINGS

WHEN YOU REALIZE
YOU'VE BEEN CALLING YOUR FRIEND THEIR SIBLING'S NAME FOR THE PAST WEEK

A GIRL AT THE GYM LIKED THE UNUSUAL COLOR AND TETURE OF MY LEGGINGS
BUT I WASN'T WEARING LEGGINGS

I POSTED A BAD PUN COMMENT ON CARDI B‚ÄôS FACEBOOK PAGE
AND SHE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE WHOLE POST DOWN

EVERYONE THINKS THEY'RE "AWAKE"
AND I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO SLEEP

I FOUND OUT THAT MY FRENCH PRESS COFFEE MAKER
WAS MADE IN THE PHILIPPINES. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THAT IS.

HEARS ABOUT IT?

HILLARY CLINTON LOST THE ELECTION
EVEN THOUGH I VOTED FOUR TIMES

MY PHONE DIED AND
MY CHARGER IS ACROSS THE ROOM

I AM SO OFFENDED
BY PEOPLE BEING OFFENDED

I WENT A DAY WITHOUT MAKING ANY SUBMISSIONS
NOW I'M ONCE AGAIN LIMITED TO TWO PER DAY

WHEN THERE ARE LITERAL TOILETS IN THE BATHROOM
BUT STILL PEOPLE PEE ON THE FLOOR

DON'T EVER ASK YOUR BOYFRIEND WHAT "ADIOS" MEANS
HE'LL SAY GOOD-BYE

I SPILLED MY COFFEE
IN MY FERRARI

WHEN YOU GET
89.99% ON A TEST

WHEN YOU'RE 9 MONTHS PREGNANT
AND YOU WANTED TO NAME YOUR SON MATTHEW

I BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE NEW IPHONEX'S WITH FACE RECOGNITION
NOW I'M ON THE MOST WANTED LIST

EVEN THE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 7 DAY LEADERBOARD
MADE MORE POINTS IN A WEEK THAN I'VE MADE IN A YEAR

SEEING YOUR BANK ACOUNT
AFTER BUYING ONE ITEM....

WHEN THE BATTERIES OF YOUR TV REMOTE RUN EMPTY
AND ALL SHOPS ARE CLOSED ALREADY

I GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER IN KAHOOT
BUT I WASN‚ÄôT FAST ENOUGH

WHEN THE TEMPLATE YOU WANT IS NOT
IN THE MEME GENERATOR OF THE COMMENT SECTION

I WANT TO START A MEME WAR BETWEEN THE EVIL ARSON GIRL AND THE EVIL COWS
BUT PEOPLE ARE ONLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BAD PUN WAR.

TRIED TO UNDERSTAND
LIBERAL LOGIC

I LET ANOTHER WOMAN GO AHEAD OF ME IN THE CHECKOUT LINE, SHE ONLY HAD A FEW CANS OF FORMULA
THEN SHE PULLS OUT ALL HER WIC CHECKS!

I CAN'T CREATE ANY FUNNY POLITICAL MEME
BECAUSE TRUMP MAKES A JOKE OF HIMSELF EVERY TIME

I SUBMITTED A MEME WITH WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MY BEST MEME IDEA YET
IT DIDN'T FEATURE

LOOK
I'M HAVING A BAD DAY...SO, IF YOU'RE HOPING FOR A GOOD MEME, YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK

I HAVE TOO MANY "WEEKEND CLOTHES"
AND NOT ENOUGH WEEKEND

MY FACE WHEN WE RUN OUT OF
DORITOS AND MOUNTAIN DEW

WHEN NO ONE COMMENT S ON YOUR POST
SO YOU COMMENT YOURSELF

THAT MOMENT
WHEN YOU HAVE AN IDEA FOR A FILM/TV/BOOK BUT IS BEEN DONE BEFORE

ALREADY TIRED OF
NEXT YEAR

I HAVE A SIX-FIGURE INCOME
IF YOU COUNT THE CENTS

I JUST HAD PIZZA FOR SUPPER LAST NIGHT
TODAY THEY HAD FREE PIZZA AT WORK

NO MORE CLEAN DISHES
AND NO MORE CLEAN CLOTHES

NO, NOT MILEY CYRUS' SUMMER HOME IN MALIBU
WHAT DOES THE FIRE HAVE AGAINST HER?

I DROPPED MY PHONE IN MY SOUP
IT'S STILL FUNCTIONAL, BUT NOW I CAN'T LISTEN TO MUSIC WITHOUT MY PHONE ASKING TO POWER OFF.

I DIDN'T COUNT THE NINE MONTHS IN THE WOMB
I,M ACTUALLY 50 YEARS OLD

OH GOD
THE WIFI IS DOWN

WHEN YOU PUT THE PHONE ON CHARGING AT NIGHT
AND REALISE IN MORNING THAT IT WAS NOT PLUGGED IN PROPERLY

I CAN'T EMPTY MY COMPUTER
FBI TOOK IT

I TRIED SO HARD AND GOT SO FAR
BUT IN THE END IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER

WHEN YOU START YOUR ESSAY
BUT DON'T KNOW THE THESIS

I'VE BEEN ON THIS SITE FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
AND I'M ONLY ON 29K POINTS

FINDS HER SPIRIT ANIMAL
IT'S 'THE PIG'

NONE OF MY FRIENDS ARE ON IMGFLIP
SO I CAN'T BRAG THAT I HAVE SIGNED RAYDOG MEMES

WHEN YOUR IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR VOICEMAIL THEN YOUR PHONE DIES
FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS

I WANT TO MAKE A GOOD MEME
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO FARM NERGIGANTE
BUT ONLY NOOBS RESPOND TO YOUR S.O.S. FLARE AND ALL FAINT SIMULTANEOUSLY...

WHEN YOU THINK OF AN AWESOME MEME
BUT WHILE YOU'RE MAKING IT YOU FORGET WHAT YOUR IDEA WAS

ME, TRYING TO BE DR X
FROM THE X-MEN MOVIES!

LOITERING RUSSIAN SHIP
HAVING FLASHBACKS OF 1980'S COLD WAR

ASKS FOR SWITCH FOR BIRTHDAY
GETS A WII U INSTEAD

WHEN YOU JUST
CAN'T HANDLE IT ANYMORE

WHEN YOU WANT TO CREATE YOUR 69TH GOOGLE ACCOUNT
BUT CAN'T THINK OF A FITTING NAME FOR THE MILESTONE

JUST GOT DONE WATCHING RICK ASTLEY'S NEVER GOING TO GIVE YOU UP VIDEO
THAT KID LOOKED WAY TOO YOUNG TO HAVE THAT DEEP VOICE

OH NO! THEY SAID MY NEW CAR
USES OIL!!!

MY STAR TREK SATNAV
KEEPS TELLING ME TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE BEFORE

WHEN YOU'RE GOING AFTER A CERTAIN POKEMON
BUT THE ENCOUNTER RATE IS ONLY 1%

READING IMGFLIP MEMES WITH TYPOS
IS MAKING ME FORGET HOW TO SPELL

WHEN YOUR COMMENT GETS MORE VIEWS AND UPVOTES
THAN YOUR OWN MEME

VIRTUAL BOYS
ARE TOO AMAZING!

I FORGOT TO TAKE MY FITBIT TO THE GYM
I HAD TO USE A STOPWATCH AS A STOPWATCH

CONSUELLA QUIT
I HAD TO FOLD MY OWN LAUNDRY TODAY

MICROWAVE STOPS WORKING
HAS TO USE THE OVEN

GOING TO THE STORE TO BUY THE GAME YOU ALWAYS WANTED
AND THE GAME IS SOLD OUT

HE PROVIDED A NICE HOUSE, VEHICLE, AND CLOTHES AND NEVER A WANT FOR FOOD
BUT HE WON'T ALWAYS TELL ME HE LOVES ME EVERY DAY

MY U2 SATNAV
DOESN'T HAVE ANY STREET NAMES

MOST OF THE FORKS SPOONS KNIVES AND GLASSES
WE‚ÄôRE IN THE OLD DISHWASHER WHEN IT WAS HAULED AWAY

THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD THAT WOULD LOVE TO GET THE MEDICAL ATTENTION AND SURGICAL CARE I RECEIVE THROUGH THE VA
AND I JUST WANT IT ALL TO STOP

HILLARY CLINTON‚ÄôS PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS MEANS
MORE SPIN WHAT IS THE TRUTH

HE ATE MY
BIGMAC

I REALLY WANT TO SAVE MY MEME SUBMISSIONS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION
BUT I DON'T WANT THEM TO GET CRAPPY FEATURE TIMES

MY WORST SUBMISSION EVER
(INSERT JOKE HERE)

BRITAIN LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION
I'M AFRAID I WON'T GET SEE THE FINALE SEASON OF 'ORPHAN BLACK' IN 2017

ALMOST TO 3K :)
ILL UPVOTE YOUR MEMES IF YOU UPVOTE THIS ONE AND COMMENT!

THE LINE AT STARBUCKS WAS TOO LONG
I WAS LATE FOR MY YOGA SESSION

WHEN YOU REALIZE
LEGO WEEK IS OVER

JUST ONCE I'D LIKE ONE OF THESE PHARMACEUTICAL COMMERCIALS TO SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE LIKE
PROMOTES WEIGHT LOSS, REDUCES WRINKLES AND GIVES YOU LOTS OF ENERGY WITHOUT 75% CHANCE OF DEATH

IF GOD IS REAL AND ALL POWERFULL
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING GODS WARS ?

THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE FAMOUS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY REPLIES TO YOUR COMMENTS
BUT REALISE THAT YOU'RE REPLYING TO YOUR OWN COMMENTS

OVERWATCH COST TO MUCH
I CAN ONLY GET TF2

WHEN YOU CANT FIND YOUR MEME THAT YOU SUBMITTED
BUT NOT FEATURED

AFTER DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME ENDED I HAD TO USE THE EXTRA HOUR TO MENTALLY PREPARE MYSELF
FOR THE MICROWAVE CLOCK BEING WRONG FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS

IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD
THE ONE HOUSE HASN'T PUT OUT ALL THEIR CHRISTMAS BLOWUPS

WATCHING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM
AND THE SUBTITLES ARE COVERING THE NIPPLES

WHEN IT'S JUNE 25TH 2009
AND MICHAEL JACKSON DIED

LONG NAILS
CAN'T FINGER MYSELF

I'M STARVING AND I REALLY NEED TO PEE
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET OUT OF BED

I TOLD HIM I WAS PREGNANT
THEN HE SAID HE GOT A VASECTOMY FIVE YEARS AGO

THE BIGGEST BLIGHT TO THE FIELDS OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHOLOGY
IS THE PEOPLE IN THESE FIELDS WHO DON'T PRACTICE ACTUAL SCIENCE, SCIENTIFIC METHOD, OR OBJECTIVITY. (S.J.COLE)

I READ THE NEWS
THIS WORLD MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT

I JUST UPVOTED THE WHOLE FRONT PAGE
AND REALIZED IMGFLIPPERS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE I LIKE ON THE INTERNET

First they tell me "Be the bigger person ."
Then they start body shaming !

I'M SLOWLY RUNNING OUT OF
MEME IDEAS!!!

FORGOT TO SWITCH MY PHONE TO WIFI WHEN I GOT HOME
ACCIDENTALLY USED ALL MY DATA

GOT OUT OF BED TO GET SOME FOOD
THERE IS NOTHING ON THE COUNTER FOR ME TO EAT

I'M AMERICAN, AND I'M SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE SAYING AMERICA IS THE STUPIDEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
PERSONALLY, I THINK EUROPE IS THE STUPIDEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD

NO ONE HAS TALKED TO ME FOR THE PAST
2 MINUTES

FORGOT TO SHAKE THE KETCHUP
RED WATER ALL OVER MY FRIES

I HATE MY
JOB

ALL I WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS WAS CAPTAIN AMERICA
AND I DIDN'T GET HIM!

WHAT TO DO WITH ALL MY FREE TIME
NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO MESS WITH ELF ON THE SHELF

CAN'T STOP THESE TEARS
BUT THERE'S NO POINT CRYING ABOUT IT

MY HUSBAND FARTS IN HIS SLEEP
AND ITS VERY SMELLY

MSM: WE ALMOST HAD AMERICANS CONVIENCED TRUMP WAS A LYING SELFISH RACIST
BUT THEN HE DONATES $1 MILLION AND TAKES SELFIES WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WE NEED A NEW PLAN ON HOW TO DESTROY THIS COUNTRY.

My Internet speed
is only 50 Mbps

NOBODY KNOWS WHERE MY JOHNNY HAS GONE BUT JUDY LEFT THE SAME TIME
WHY WAS HE HOLDING HER HAND
WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE MINE

THE FONT SHADOW
ISN'T WORKING

PLEASE DON'T HATE ME FOR THIS
BUT I DON'T LIKE BAD PUN DOG MEMES

I'M MAKING A MEME
AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE TO PICK

WHEN YOU PUT THE WRIST STRAP
ON THE JOYCON THE WRONG WAY

SO MANY SHOWS TO WATCH
CAN'T DECIDE WHICH ONE

HE SAW ME
SPRAYING FEBREEZE UP UNDER MY SKIRT...

ANOTHER PERSON COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO
UNREVERSE MY FRIGGIN PHONE#

WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT TOOTSIE ROLLS ARE
ACTUALLY TAFFY MADE THAT'S CHOCOLATE FLAVORED

THE MOMENT YOU FIGURE OUT
YOU'RE MORE LIBERAL THAN LIBERALS

SWITCHED FROM CABLE TO SATELLITE
NEED TO LEARN A WHOLE NEW REMOTE CONTROL

MY PARENTS KNOW THE EXACT DAY I WAS CONCEIVED
AND THEY LET ME KNOW, TOO

WHEN YOU GET ON FACEBOOK AND REALIZE
YOUR ONLY LIKES ARE FROM YOUR MOM

I CAN'T THINK OF AN IDEA FOR A MEME
SO I MADE A MEME ABOUT NOT HAVING AN IDEA FOR A MEME

I HAVE A NEW FAVORITE CHARACTER
BUT NOW THAT CHARACTER IS DEAD

WHEN YOU THINK ITS A CHOCO CHIP MUFFIN
WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY A RAISIN MUFFIN

MY COMPUTER
HAS A PIXEL LAPSE IN ONE CORNER

JUST FOUND OUT
WHY GRASS SMELLS LIKE GRASS

I THINK I MIGHT BE ADDICTED TO MEMES
I'VE STARTED USING MEME TEMPLATES WHEN I TEXT PEOPLE

MY MOM USED TO TAKE ME KROGERING
SINGLE MOM'S GO DOLLAR GENERALING

I SAID TOO MY HUSBAND YOU CAN TIE ME UP AND DO WHAT EVER YOU LIKE
SO HE DID. THEN WENT TO THE STRIPCLUB WITH HIS FRIENDS AND DID SHOTS ALL NIGHT

I KEEP UPLOADING MEMES AT 10:00 PM EST
BUT NO ONE SEES THEM, AND THAT'S THE ONLY TIME I'M ABLE TO UPLOAD

TOLD HIM THAT I SWALLOWED A BOTTLE OF SLEEPING PILLS
HE SAID TO HAVE A FEW DRINKS AND GET SOME REST

I CREATED A MEME WHERE TRUMP WAS EATING TACO, RIDING ON A PONY AND BUILDING A WALL
BUT NONE LAUGHED AT IT

I CANT COME UP WITH A REGULAR MEME IDEA
NOW THEY HAVE SPECIFIC THEMES

THAT MOMENT YOU REALIZE
YOU HAVEN'T SAVED SINCE HELGEN

WHEN YOU RELATE TO
ALL THE DEPRESSION MEMES

HE THINKS I SLAVED ALL DAY OVER THE STOVE
GLAD I HID THE INSTANT POT

I SHOWED MY FRIENDS HOW TO MAKE MEMES
NONE OF THEM ARE FUNNY

MY ELECTRIC CAR ONLY
GETS 200 MILES ON A CHARGE

I JUST WANT TO ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS
WHILE ONLY EXERTING MINIMAL EFFORT

I GLUED MYSELF TO
THE CEILING

Calories are just like small creatures in your closet
Sewing each clothe tighter every night

DIDN'T WANT EITHER OF THESE LOSERS TO BECOME PRESIDENT
ONE OF THEM BECAME PRESIDENT

WHEN THE INTERNET GOES DOWN
AND YOU DONT HAVE ANY FRIENDS

NO, I DON'T USE METHAMPHETAMINES
ITS ADHD

SO CRAZY BUSY TODAY
DIDN'T HAVE FOR IMGFLIP

Whoever said, "$h!t Happens!"
was never constipated.

WHEN YOU GET TO 20,000 POINTS QUICKLY
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT STAY THERE AWHILE

PETE'S DRAGON REMAKE COMING OUT IN AUGUST
STARFLIGHT IS GOING TO BE INSUFFERABLE

HOW IT FEELS WHEN YOUR EYES GET DAMAGED
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WEAR GOGGLES

WHEN YOUR TEACHER SAYS
YOU CAN'T EAT DURING THE LAB

WHEN YPUR PHONE TAKES 3 HOURS TO CHARGE
AND IT GOES TO 0% IN 10 MINS

MORE WHITE MALES ARE KILLED BY POLICE THAN BLACK MALES
NOBODY DOES ANYTHING

NO ROOM FOR ICE CREAM
THE FREEZER'S TOO FULL.

MY HOUSE LOOKS LIKE
I'M LOSING A GAME OF JUMANJI

WHEN YOU LOSE TO A
NO SKIN IN FORTNITE

*SIGH*
I JUST BLEW UP THE KITCHEN TRYING TO MICROWAVE SOME COFFEE

WHILE IN BED... WITH A BLANKET IT'S TOO HOT
WITHOUT IT IT'S TOO COLD!

IT'S LIKE TRUMP AND CLINTON ARE DIVORCED PARENTS FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY OF US
AND I JUST WANNA GO LIVE WITH GRANDMA

RICH, POWERFUL MEN
FIND WOMEN ATTRACTIVE

STARBUCKS
IS CLOSED

CREATES 2 MEMES EVERYDAY
AND NONE OF THEM GET TO FRONT PAGE

I MISSED SCHOOL THE DAY THEY GAVE OUT
THE WHITE PRIVILEGE DECODER RING AND SHOWED US THE SECRET HAND SHAKE

THE MEME I WAS GOING TO SUBMIT
WAS ALREADY SUBMITTED BY ANOTHER USER

I FORGOT TO CHARGE MY PHONE
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE MY SHOPPING LIST

WHEN I DIE ON FORTNITE
BYE A NOOB

THE FACE YOU MAKE
WHEN YOUR TEACHER CAUGHT YOU MAKING THIS MEME

SEEING PEOPLE RACIST
LGBT

I ALWAYS GET A HEADACHE
WHENEVER I SEE THAT GLEAM IN MY HUSBAND'S EYES

SOME WOMEN BE LIKE
WHY DID HE FINISH SO SOON?!?!?!?!?!

THAT ONE TIME AT BAND CAMP
HAS RUINED MY LIFE FOREVER

I SAW THERE WAS ONE BROWNIE LEFT
RIGHT AFTER I DRANK THE LAST OF THE MILK

I'M TOO PARANOID TO EVER LIVE ALONE
BUT I THINK EVERYONE IS A GOVERNMENT SPY SO I HAVE PROBLEMS DEVELOPING CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE

THERE AREN'T ANY PARKING SPOTS ON CAMPUS
NOW I'LL HAVE TO WALK AN ENTIRE MILE, AND I DON'T WANT MY $2,000 DRESS TO BE COVERED IN SWEAT

OH SHIT
HE IS LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW AT ME !

I keep clicking the TEXT COMMENT button
before I type in the text.

WIFI IS DOWN
WARNING: MIGHT HAVE TO USE MOBILE DATA

I ASKED THE DOCTOR WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME
GAVE ME A 1,000 PAGE LIST OF WOMEN PROBLEMS

DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY HAVE
IMGFLIP PRO?

I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN STRESS OVER THINGS I CAN'T CONTROL
BUT YET I CAN BARELY CONTROL THE STRESS

JOINS IMGFLIP
FEELS LIKE NO ONE USES THIS WEBSITE BECAUSE NO ONE UP VOTES OR COMMENTS ON YOUR POSTS

I WAS GOING TO LEARN HOW TO STOP PROCRASTINATING
BUT I KEEP PUTTING IT OF

AFTER A MONTH IN MY NEW ROLE, WORKMATES INVITE ME OUT FOR DRINKS
TO A WHISKEY AND JAZZ BAR

I DECIDED TO CHANGE MY USERNAME
I‚ÄôM HAVING SERIOUS SELF CONFLICT RIGHT NOW

I CANNOT FIT ANY MORE FOOD
IN MY FRIDGE

ALL THIS GOOD FREE FOOD FOR HURRICANE VICTIMS
AND NO PIZZA

VERY HUNGRY
BUT ALREADY BRUSHED TEETH

THAT JERK CARRIES AROUND A JAR WITH A CRICKET IN IT
FOR THOSE UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSES IN CONVERSATION.

MY ROLLS ROYCE NEEDS THE OIL CHANGED TODAY
THAT MEANS I'M STUCK DRIVING THE PORSHE 911!

THE NEIGHBOURS' KIDS
ARE REHEARSING THEIR STRING QUARTET REALLY LOUDLY AGAIN

MY KID GOT ALL STRAIGHT A'S
I AM NOT SMARTER THAN A FIFTH GRADER

WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN
WHICH WILL MAKE WOMEN LOOK REALLY GULLABLE

CAN'T AFFORD A NEW IPHONE
BECAUSE OF MY 3 SOYA LATTE A DAY HABIT

IT TOOK ME 2 WEEKS TO GET USED TO MEMING ON MY LAPTOP
NOW, I JUST GOT MY PHONE BACK AND IT TOOK ME THREE MINUTES TO TYPE THIS

WANTS OPEN BORDERS AND NO VOTER ID
CRIES WHEN ELECTION MAY BE COMPROMISED

I COULDN'T THINK OF A MEME TO CREATE
AND I ENDED UP WASTING MY SUBMISSION BECAUSE I DIDN'T UPLOAD ANYTHING.

PLEASE
NO MORE LONG MEMES

I'M SO PRETTY
GUYS ARE AFRAID TO ASK ME OUT

WHEN YOU THINK OF A REALLY CLEVER MEME IDEA
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SUBMISSIONS LEFT

WISH I COULD UPVOTE MY OWN MEMES
SO THEY COULD HAVE ONE LIKE

OMG, A VIDEO
CAN'T I JUST READ ABOUT THIS

FINALLY FOUND THE TUBE OF OINTMENT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IN MY MEDICINE CABINET
BUT IT EXPIRED IN 1987

OFFICE CHOCOLATES ARE $1
SMALLEST NOTE I HAVE IS

THEY CALL A 3 DAY WEEKEND LONG
AND A 4 DAY WORKWEEK SHORT

RIP

BUT TRUMPCARE SUCKS EVEN WORSE!

I TOLD MYSELF I WASN'T GONNA CRY DURING PENNY DREADFUL'S SERIES FINALE
I CRIED

I CREATED A REALLY FUNNY MEME
IT GOT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF IMGFLIP BECAUSE SOMEONE REPOSTED IT

EVERYONE IN MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL CLASSES NOW HAVE A JOB AND GET PAID GOOD MONEY
WHILE I'M HERE MAKING MEMES ON IMGFLIP

BREXIT
THE ONLY TIME AMERICANS WILL TALK ABOUT OUR COUNTRY

WHEN UR PHONE DIES
#FIRSTWORLDPROBLEMS

WHEN YOUR SIBLING EATS
THE FOOD YOU SAVED IN THE FRIDGE

I WANT TO TAKE A YOGA CLASS
BUT I CANT TRUST MY FARTS

MY MEMORY FOAM PILLOW

WHY DID NOAH LET THOSE
TWO MOSQUITOES ON THE ARK

OUR COCKROACH GAVE BIRTH TO TRIPLETS
HAD TO MOVE INTO A DOUBLEWIDE TO MAKE ROOM

WHEN YOU GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE
AND FIND THAT IT WAS A DREAM

WE'D ALL BE ALONE

WITHOUT ISSAC MENDALS CREATING THE SCIENCE OF GENETICS
OUR WAY OF LIFE WOULD DAY :(

OBAMA ELECTED TWICE = NOTHING
TRUMP ELECTED = RIOTS , WHINING, CRYING

WHEN YOU THINK THERE IS LEFTOVERS
AND THERE IS NONE

SO MANY COMPLAINING ABOUT TROLLS
SO FEW WILLING TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE LIKE ADULTS

WHEN THEY ALWAYS MAKE YOU LAUGH
SO YOU CAN'T EVER BE MAD AT THEM

I GOT 99 PROBLEMS
AND MY LIFE IS ONE

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT IN LIFE
BUT I KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T IT

THE REPUBLICANS WON'T LET ME PAY FOR AN ABORTION
BY USING MY HEALTH INSURANCE

I DON‚ÄôT LIKE ALINSKY‚ÄôS RULES FOR RADICALS

I JUST DON'T GET IT. MY CUSTOM MEMES ARE TAGGED WITH "MEMES," AND FEATURED
BUT THEY DON'T SHOW UP IN ANY LISTS UNLESS THE "OTHER" FILTER IS CHECKED

THOUGHT OF THE BEST MEME EVER
USED UP ALL MY SUBMISSIONS,
AND THEN FORGOT IT THE NEXT DAY

NO MATTER HOW I MAKE A MEME
IT WON'T MAKE FIRST PAGE, EVEN ON LATEST

I WANT TO SUPPORT THE LGBT COMMUNITY
BUT I DON'T WANT TO CRITICIZE ISLAM.

NOW I CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT POLITIC MEMES
RUINING MY "FUN"

MY HR DIRECTOR IS A WOMAN
AND I STILL ONLY GET PAID HALF AS MUCH AS A MAN WHO WORKS TWICE AS MANY HOURS.

THIS GIRL TOLD HER FRIENDS SHE WAS AN ATHEIST

WHEN THE PERSON IN FRONT OF U TAKES THE LAST CHOCOLATE MILK

HERE'S AN OVERLY SENSITIVE PERSON
SHE THINKS THE INTERNET ISN'T A PLACE WITHOUT RULES

COFFEE GOT COLD
WHILE I WAS HEATING MY BREAKFAST IN THE MICROWAVE

I ACCIDENTALLY BOUGHT LARGE
CURD COTTAGE CHEESE

SOMEONE SKIPPED A FEW SLICES OF BREAD IN THE LOAF
NOW MY SANDWICH DOESN'T LINE UP EVENLY

SO MUCH NONSENSE ON FACEBOOK TODAY
WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAYS?

IT'S SO COLD OUTSIDE
THAT MY SODA FREEZES AND I HAVE TO USE THE OTHER FRIDGE IN THE GARAGE.

MY PC LOADED MY GAME SO FAST
I COULDN'T READ THE TIPS ON THE LOADING SCREEN

I NEED HELP

THE PART WHEN YOU MOVE THE STRAW AND YOU GET BASICALLY NO DRINK.

DON'T HAVE TO WORK ALL DAY JUST TO SURVIVE
GET BORED AND WIND UP EATING JUST TO KILL TIME

WHEN YOU FORGET
TO GRAB YOUR TOWEL BEFORE THE SHOWER

THE REMOTES OVER THERE
BUT I'M OVER HERE

I'M SO FATIGUED
MY FATIGUE FEELS FATIGUED!

MUHAMMED ALI DIED
I'VE SUDDENLY BEEN A FAN ALL OF MY LIFE

MY CHEAP AND READILY AVAILABLE MEDICINE
IS DISGUSTING

ALL WOMEN VOTING FOR CLINTON
SOULD HAVE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS REMOVED

WHEN NO ONE SEES
WHAT YOU DID THERE

MY HUSBAND SAID I WAS A FEMALE
TAKES A FEE TO GET ME , A FEE TO KEEP ME AND A BIGGER FEE TO GET RID OF ME!

IM THINKING ABOUT TAKING THE MONEY I WAS GOING TO SPEND ON MY TEENAGERS FOR CHRISTMAS
AND GOING TO A TROPICAL ISLAND FOR 3 MONTHS....BY MYSELF.

I CAN'T LOOK AT A BOX OF CHOCOLATES
WITHOUT THINKING OF FORREST GUMP

ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY
USE THE WRONG MEME

I PURCHASED A LOTTERY TICKET IN
MEXICO ON A TRIP AS A JOKE THEN I WON UNABLE TO CLAIM IT

THE PEOPLE ON THE LEADERBOARD MAKE MORE POINTS IN A WEEK
THAN I HAVE TOTAL

ANYONE THAT IS FOUND COMMITING VOTER FRAUD
SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT AND SHOT!

WHEN YOU HAVE A DREAM IT WAS FRIDAY
BUT WAKE UP AND REALIZE IT'S MONDAY

I COMBINED MY CELLPHONE WITH MY WALLET
NOW I DONT KNOW WHICH POCKET TO PUT IT IN

THE ONLY RING HES GIVEN ME
IS THE ONE AROUND MY TUB

I REALLY WISH I HAD A HANDICAP PLATE
THIS WAY I COULD GET FULL SERVICE AT SELF SERVICE PRICE

WHEN YOU'RE BROWSING MEMES
AND ONE HITS TOO CLOSE

EVERYONE TELLS HER TO GET ONE OF THE STEM DEGREES
TAKES WOMEN'S STUDIES BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO EXPERIENCE INCOME INEQUALITY

I'M STILL HUNGRY AFTER ONE PLATE AT THE CHINESE BUFFET
BUT I'M TOO LAZY TO GET OUT OF MY SEAT

I DON'T ALWAYS USE THE WRONG TEMPLATE
BUT WHEN I DO, ITS OBVIOUS

MY OVEN STOPPED WORKING
NOW I HAVE TO CLEAN IT BEFORE THE REPAIRMAN SEES IT

MY AVERAGE IS 89 VIEWS
AND 3 UPVOTES

THAT LOOK THE WIFE GIVES YOU
WHEN SHE REALISES THAT YOU'LL NEVER STOP PLAYING AIR GUITAR AND DRUMS.

MY BEAUTIFUL MEME ABOUT FRIENDSHIP HAS 2 LIKES
YET MY RELATIONSHIP STATUS HAS OVER 1,000 VIEWS AND 85 LIKES.

WHEN YOUR MVP IN RAINBOW SIX SIEGE
WITH 7 SECONDS REMAINING
BUT UBISOFT SERVERS GIVE OUT AND YOU LAG OUT

THAT AWKWARD MOMENT
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG THAT YOU FORGOTTEN ALMOST EVERYBODY ON THE SITE.

SOMEONE CALLED ME FAT
LET ME SIT IN A CORNER AND CRY BECAUSE OF WORDS

I JUST LEARNT THAT MY MOTHER
IS STILL A VIRGIN

MY YAHOO ACCOUNT GOT HACKED
TO FIX IT I NEED TO LOG IN, BUT I DON'T REMEMBER MY PASSWORD FROM 2001.

US TRAILER PARK WIVES WERE COMPARING ENGAGEMENT RINGS
ONLY MINE WAS PURCHASED AT A TRUCK STOP

GOT A NEW AND BIGGER IPHONE
DOESN'T MATCH THE TIGHT JEANS-MARKS IN MY POCKETS

THAT FEELING WHEN SOMEONE SPELLS
YOU'RE AS YOUR

IMGFLIP only gave me two submissions today
And I just wasted one on this

READS INSPIRATIONAL MEME, QUITS JOB AND IS ELATED AT THE NEW UNKNOWN
CRIES IN BED THE NEXT DAY AS ANXIETY ATTACK BACKLASH HITS FULL TORNADO TO THE FACE

BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE LEFTOVER KFC ALL DAY AT WORK
BUT SOMEONE ALREADY ATE IT

WHEN FINAL EXAMS ARE COMING
AND YOU HAVEN'T STUDIED

I WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE A PICTURE OF A LARGE CHIP
BUT IT FELL AND CRACKED AND WHEN I PIECE IT BACK TOGETHER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE ME

WHEN THERE IS NO
CHICKEN NUGGETS LEFT IN THE WORLD

HE SAID HE WAS "AMPED" AND WAS GOING TO DRIVE OVER THE "BRIDGE"
IN HIS "PICK UP" AND "STRING" ME UP WITH A "CHORD" AROUND MY "NECK"

I WOKE UP SO HAPPY THIS MORNING
THEN I REALIZED TODAY IS MONDAY

I WANT TO PLAY PUBG
BUT MY FRIENDS WILL MAKE FUN OF ME

YOU WROTE A NICE COMMENT ON MY FACEBOOK POST
BUT YOU DIDN'T CLICK "LIKE!"

WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED THEY GAVE THE PULITZER TO THE NEW YORK TIMES
FOR MANUFACTURING FAKE NEWS STORIES ABOUT RUSSIAN HACKERS INFLUENCING THE ELECTION.

FACEBOOK SAID MY FRIEND COMMENTED ON A CERTAIN POST
THERE WERE 18,675 COMMENTS AND I COULDN'T FIND MY FRIEND'S COMMENT ANYWHERE

Added a sentence between two lines using a carrot
Read the sentence and discovered a missing word

I SUED THE AIRLINE FOR LOSING MY LUGGAGE
I LOST MY CASE

I LOST MY CONTACTS
NOW NO ONE CAN SEE ME

WHEN SHE KEEPS SAYING SHE'S HUGE
BUT HER WHOLE BODY IS LIKE THE SIZE OF MY DAMN LEG

MY U2 SATNAV
DOESN'T HAVE ANY STREET NAMES

THE BATTERIES RAN OUT ON MY HOVERBOARD
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD TO WALK TO THE OTHER ROOM

I CAN‚ÄôT TELL IF I GOT MORE TAKE HOME PAY FROM TRUMPS TAX PLAN
BECAUSE I GOT A RAISE THE SAME TIME THE TAX PLAN KICKED IN

I STARTED GOING ON IMGFLIP TO KEEP ME OFF FACEBOOK
NOW I CAN'T STAY OFF IMGFLIP

I HAD SO MANY CHECKS TO DEPOSIT
I HAD TO USE TWO DEPOSIT SLIPS

MY SUNDAY SCHOOL KIDS ARE ALWAYS SLEEPY AND INATTENTIVE SO I BOUGHT THEM CHOCOLATES
NOW THEY'RE HYPERACTIVE AND INATTENTIVE

I ONLY HAVE 177 SEEDS ON MY HAMBURGER BUN
NOT 178

WALKING AWAY FROM SOMEONE DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN YOU ARE TURNING YOUR BACK ON THEM. LET THEM GO SO THEY CAN FIND THE STRENGTH TO STAND ON THEIR OWN
AND YOU CAN FIND REST FROM CARRYING THEIR BURDENS & YOURS. DON'T BE AFRAID TO WALK AWAY

I'M TOO TIRED TO BE ONLINE
I'M POSTING STUPID SHIZ ALL OVER THE PLACE

HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT BISEXUALS
IF THERE ARE 56 DIFFERENT GENDERS?

I'M SO BUSY POSTING HOBBIES ON PINTEREST
I HAVEN'T TIME FOR ANY

WONDERS "WHY AM I STILL SINGLE?"
FORGETS ALL THE LOYAL GUYS SHE PUT INTO THE "SPECIAL FRIENDS" CATEGORY

WHEN YOUR FREIND
IS BETTER AT MAKING MEMES THAN YOU

WHEN YOU CANT USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE
ON THE TEST

I DONT KNOW WHY SHE LIKES ME
BUT I LIKE HER

HE HAD DUCK FOR SUPPER
TOSSED MY SALAD TO GET THE TASTE OUT OF HIS MOUTH

NOW WE GET TO SEE WHO WE CAN VOTE FOR
IN 2020

TRUMP AND CLINTON AREN'T JUST DISLIKABLE ANYMORE
THEY'RE DISGUSTING

EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT MY ARMANI JACKET
NO ONE NOTICED MY SPEECH

WHEN THEY DECIDED TO START KEEPING SCORE AT HIS BASEBALL GAMES

WAITING ALL DAY TO OPEN MY PACK OF HOT CHEETOS

IT WAS THAT DARN SONG ABOUT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AGAIN

WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY WANT THE SAME THING YOU DO
BUT BARELY DO ANYTHING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, LEAVING YOU WITH ALL THE WORK

I WAS IN THE VIP SECTION AT THE DEPECHE MODE CONCERT LAST NIGHT

I THINK I MAY HAVE ALZHEIMER'S
NOT ONLY AM I OLD AND DECREPIT BUT I FORGET THAT I'M OLD AND DECREPIT

WHEN THE ICE CREAM TRUCK DRIVES BY YOUR HOUSE
AND DRIVES AWAY BEFORE YOU CAN FIND YOUR MONEY AND GET OUT THERE

WHEN THE MEME THAT YOU COMMENTED WITH HAS MORE VIEWS
THAN THE ONE THAT YOU CREATED AFTER DAYS OF CREATIVE THOUGHT

AFTER LISTENING TO ALL OF THE POST DEBATE COMMENTS
I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I MUST HAVE WATCHED A DIFFERENT DEBATE

WHEN YOUR FAVORITE STORY DRIVEN
SERIES ENDS ON THE REVEAL OF A CHARACTER YOU LOVE BEING ALIVE

I WAITED 180 SECONDS TO POST BETWEEN MESSAGES ON FACEBOOK
BECAUSE IMGFLIP MADE ME COMMENT THAT WAY

I FORGOT TO REMOVE THAT CARD BOARD DISK
FROM UNDERNEATH THE PEPPERONI PIZZA BEFORE I COOKED IT

I SAID THAT WON'T WORK GO GET MY UMBRELLA

GREAT MEMES AND THE THREADS ATTACHED TO THEM ARE DISAPPEARING FROM IMGFLIP
LIKE THAT ONE WHERE THE OAG OFFERED TO LET SOME GUY MILK HER

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
IF TRUMP WOULD HAVE BEATEN HILLARITY TO DEATH WITH A STACK OF 30,000 EMAILS

MY FRIEND LIVES NEAR A COFFEE PLACE AND A PIZZERIA
I LIVE NEAR A SUBWAY WHERE I FOUND A HAIR IN MY SUB

BEING CONSTIPATED
IS A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS

WITH ALL THESE REPOSTS AND LACK OF ORIGINAL CONTENT ON IMGFLIP
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO GET SOME WORK DONE.

KEPT HITTING REFRESH TO SEE IF I HAD ANY NEW NOTIFICATIONS
IMGFLIP HAD LOGGED ME OUT WITHOUT ME REALIZING, SO REFRESHING DID NOTHING

WHY IS IT EASIER TO FIND A BOYFRIEND
THAN A GOOD FWB

WHEN YOU HAVE AN "A-" IN YOUR REPORT CARD

AND YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY WAKES UP

WHEN THERES NOT
AN APP FOR THAT

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS
BUT ALL YOU WANT IS CHOCOLATE.

WHEN YOU REALIZE
ITS MONDAY MORNING

WHEN YOU THINK OF THE BEST MEME
AND REALIZE YOU HAVE NO MORE SUBMISSIONS

IT'S NOT THE HOLIDAYS THAT STRESS ME OUT
IT'S FAMILY & FRIENDS THAT COME OVER , ENJOY , BUT DO NOTHING TO HELP ME OUT THEN LEAVE

I ASKED FOR EARL GREY
THEY GAVE ME GREEN TEA

FACEBOOK SHOWED ME A MEMORY
THAT INCLUDED PEOPLE WHO HAVE UNFRIENDED ME

THE STUPID IT HURTS
MAKE IT GO AWAY

I ATE SUPER

BUT "BIG BROTHER" MAKES ME CRY

IF YOU THINK NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU
TRY MISSING A COUPLE OF PAYMENTS.

SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE A BRAIN
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

TOILET PAPER TOWARDS OR AWAY FROM THE WALL
WHY DOES LIFE HAVE TO BE SO HARD

I COULDN'T OPEN
A WATERMELON

WHEN YOU ASK YOUR FRIEND TO GET YOU SOMETHING
BUT THEY SAY NO

I MADE BROWNIES
BUT THEY‚ÄôRE NOT COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH

HOW COME MEMES THAT MAKE NO SENSE
HAVE MORE VIEWS THAT ONES THAT DO MAKE SENSE?

MY CARBON FOOTPRINT INCREASED
BECAUSE I DROVE MY CAR FOR VACATION

I ASKED MY MAN TO PUT HIMSELF IN MY POSITION
SO HE BOUGHT ME A STRAP ON AND TOLD ME TO SPOON HIM

GOT BORED OF FACEBOOK
OPEN NEW TAB TO GO TO FACEBOOK

SHARK WEEK IS ALMOST OVER
AND THERE ARE NO PLANS FOR AN ALLIGATOR WEEK OR A GORILLA WEEK

I MADE NO MEMES YESTERDAY
SO ONLY 1 UPVOTE IS 1 POUND TO THE FINB CHARITY

THE ONLY TIME MY CELL PHONE IS LOUD ENOUGH
IS AT 3AM WHEN I FORGOT TO PUT IT ON VIBRATE BEFORE GOING TO BED

WHEN YOU POST 3 MEMES
AND YOU GET NO NOTIFICATIONS

DIDN'T GET ANY LIKE'S ON MY MEMES TODAY
SO SAD I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

I HAVE THE MONEY TO TRAVEL TO SPACE
BUT THEY'RE BOOKED UP FOR YEARS!

MY AUTOMATIC GARAGE DOOR OPENER BROKE
I HAD TO PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY

IF IT IS FOR MY BENEFIT
I DON'T WANT TO WORK EXTRA FOR IT

I TOOK THE BLUE PILL
NOW I'M LOCKED INSIDE THE MATRIX

SAID HE WANTED TO SHOW ME HIS WET WILLY
STUCK HIS FINGER IN MY EAR

Innocent babies are ripped from their mother
in the dairy industry

TOOK A NAP BECAUSE I WAS TIRED
NOW IM EVEN MORE TIRED

FIND THE PERFECT GAME
ALL AVATARS ARE MALE

HOW CAN I TRULY EMBRACE MEME CULTURE
WHEN ALL FRONT PAGE MEMES JUST USE OLD TEMPLATES WITH IMPACT FONT?

WANTING TO THROW A POOL PARTY
BUT IT'S GONNA RAIN.

MY(MOM) SON'S FRIENDS
CALL ME GAY

MY HUSBAND IS SO MUCH BETTER LOOKING THAN ME
THAT A CASHIER JUST PUT A PLASTIC DIVIDER DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR GROCERIES

TOOK A SELFIE
WHEN I POCKET DAILED MYSELF!

EVERY GIRL IN MY CLASS LIKES JUSTIN BIEBER
OR JACON SARTORIOUS

USED THE BATTERIES FROM THE VIBRATOR TO RUN THE XBOX CONTROLLER
NOW THEY'RE FLAT AND I CAN'T USE THE XBOX OR MY VIBRATOR

MY HUSBAND FOUND A CARROT IN THE SHOWER
TOLD THE KIDS NOT TO EAT THEIR VEGGIES ANYMORE

WHEN YOU REALIZE
THERE IS NO INTERNET FOR CANDY CUSH

EVERYBODY'S USING COLORS FOR THEIR TEXT
EXCEPT ME

MY FAVORITE GUM FLAVOR
RUNS OUT OF FLAVOR IN 5 SECONDS

MIRROR BACKUP SERVERS IN SAFE, REMOTE AREA
DESTROYED BY FIRE IN ALBERTA

YOU KNOW IM NOT HAPPY
YOU KNOW THAT IM TRYING

THE WORLD IS GONNA END
STARTING TODAY HILLARY WILL BE ELECTED AS PRESIDENT

GAVE SUPER $50 TIP TO INSTALL AC
NOW HE WON'T LEAVE AND IS FIXING OTHER THINGS

WHY IS IT THAT MY THANK YOU MEMES
GET ONE UPVOTE

IM SORRY IMGFLIP
I DIDENT MEME IT

I THOUGHT OF AN AWESOME MEME YESTERDAY, BUT I WAS OUT OF SUBMISSIONS, SO I WAITED UNTIL TOMORROW
...AND PROMPTLY FORGOT ABOUT IT.

WHEN YOU'RE CONSERVATIVE
BUT ALL YOUR FAVORITE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE LIBERAL LEANINGS

FIRST HE SAYS I'VE GOT THE LOOK, THEN THAT IT MUST HAVE TAKEN A WHOLE HOUR JUST TO MAKE UP MY FACE
THEN I'M A NATURAL BEAUTY UNAFFECTED, PRAISE-INSULT-PRAISE, WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THAT?

I'VE BEEN USING THE TERM NETFLIX AND CHILL TO FRIENDS & FAMILY FOR MONTHS NOW
I JUST FOUND OUT WHAT CHILL MEANT

I'M SO TIRED OF CLEANING THE SAME THING UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN
BUT IF I REPORT IT TO UPPER MANAGEMENT MY BEST FRIEND WILL LOSE THEIR JOB

MY GF INSISTED THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP SONG
IS TREAT YOU BETTER AND ITS KILLING ME

MY MUSIC LIBRARY AND TASTE IS SO BIG
I CAN'T LISTEN TO ALL MY FAVOURITE SONGS IN 1 DAY

I DONT LIKE WHEN PEOPLE
BELITTLE ME

I SPENT $5 ON BOTTLED WATER AND A QUEST BAR
BUT MY WATER DOESN'T FIT IN MY CUPHOLDER

MY WEB FILTER WON'T LET ME ADD TAGS TO MEMES
SO I CAN'T CREATE ORIGINAL MEMES ANYMORE

WHAT IS LIFE
A JOKE

PUTS THE TV REMOTE OUT OF REACH
CAN¬¥T CHANGE THE CHANNEL

I WOULD LIKE TO EAT MORE CHIPS
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO GET UP

THE BOYFRIEND I LIVE WITH IS CLOCK BLOCKING
MY OTHER BOYFRIEND

JUST FOUND OUT HER SON SMOKES POT
NEEDS TWO GLASSES OF WINE AND AN AMBIEN TO DEAL WITH IT.

I HIT "SHOW MORE" ON ANOTHER
STUPID FORTNITE MEME

WHEN THERE ARE MEMES I COULD MAKE
GOOD COMMENTS ON, I DON'T HAVE THE TIME

THAT FACE YOU MAKE WHEN YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT
BUT YOU STILL LOSE ONE OF THE SOCKS IN YOUR FAVORITE PAIR

TRUMP, HILLARY, PUTIN, MISSILES, RIOTS
ALL I WANT IS TO MAKE IT LONG ENOUGH TO SEE ROGUE ONE

WHEN U NOTICED THE EMOJI MOVIE
CAME OUT

MY DAUGHTER CALLED ME FAT SO I TOLD HER TO "BITE ME"
NOW SHE WON'T STOP BITING ME

I AM HERE
BUT THE TV REMOTE IS OVER THERE

WRITES A LONG, WELL-THOUGHT-OUT, EMOTIONL PARAGRAPH
FINDS ERROR AFTER SENDING

MY ARM FELL ASLEEP
GREAT. NOW IT'S GOING TO BE UP ALL NIGHT

I LIKE COMMENTS MORE THAN UPVOTES
BUT WITHOUT UPVOTES NOBODY WILL SEE AND COMMENT MY MEMES

I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHEN THIS COUNTRY WAS GREAT TO BEGIN WITH!

WHEN YOU'VE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
MAKING MEMES

I can't believe it's still only Wednesday
Please hurry, Friday, please!

WHEN NANNY SENDS CHOCOLATE
AND IT ARRIVES CRUSHED

WHEN YOU ONLY GET ONE VIEW
ON YOUR FIRST MEME

WE WERE OUT OF TOWN--MISSED A CELEB AND HIS WIFE VISITING OUR TRAILER PARK

I ONLY GET SICK
ON MY DAYS OFF

I HEARD THERE WAS A SECRET CHORD THAT DAVID PLAYED AND IT PLEASED THE LORD
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY CARE FOR MUSIC

WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT
I DON'T HAVE A PHONE...

I JUST TRIED TO "DETACH AT PERFORATION"
ON A BILL I PRINTED FROM MY COMPUTER

WHEN FORGETS TO MAKE A WISHLIST FOR CHRISTMAS
AND GOT NEW SOCKS

I ran out of new memes in Latest
All the "hot" memes I've seen, because I upvoted them in Latest

BOSS OFFERED ME SEATS IN THE COMPANY BOX
I CAN'T ACCEPT THEM BECAUSE I'LL BE IN COSTA RICA

FINALLY BECAME 18
HAS TO VOTE FOR EITHER TRUMP OR HILLARY

PLEASE SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING SMART ON FRONT PAGE

ACCIDENTALLY DELETED GOOD MEME
INSTEAD OF GENERATING IT

ANYBODY ELSE SAD
THAT THE FOOTBALL SEASON IS OVER?

BIG WORDS
FOR A "LITTLE" GUY

I WAS EXCITED ABOUT BRINGING MY FRIEND TO CHURCH
THEN DURING THE HYMNS HE RAISED HIS HANDS STARTED SWAYING....THEN DURING THE SERMON , HE STARTED SPEAKING IN TONGUES

HE SAID I WAS PRETTY AS A CANVAS
BY PICASSO

LABIAPLASTY
WHAT WAS TERRI THINKING?

WHEN YOU FINISH A BIG ESSAY
AND YOU FORGET TO SUBMIT IT

PUTTING THE WORD "TROLLS" IN YOUR TITLE
SEEMS TO ATTRACT THEM

WHEN PARENTS SAY "SOON"
THEY REALLY MEAN 30 MINUTES.

CHECKED MY PHONE PERCENTAGE
2%.....NO CHARGER

MY HUSBAND DOES EVERYTHING I ASK
BUT I HAVE TO ASK HIM TO DO IT

I BROKE UP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND
BECAUSE SHE WAS TRYING TO CHANGE MY ACTIONS

I ASKED IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE GLUTEN FREE OPTION AT MY PARENTS DINNER
I WAS NOT INVITED FOR THE HOLIDAYS

WHEN THE STARBUCKS
BARISTA SPELLS YOU NAME WRONG

SERIOUSLY THINKING OF DELETING MY ACCOUNT

Needed a whatchamacallit
Hubby bought a whatchamahoozit

YOUR BEST FRIEND WALKS BY
HAND IN HAND WITH THE GIRL YOU LIKE

WHEN YOU STUDY FOR A TEST TILL 3 IN THE MORNING
AND THERE'S A SUB IN CLASS THE NEXT DAY

PEOPLE FINALLY START TALKING TO ME
TO ASK FOR HELP WITH MATH

THE PROBLEM WITH BEING THE OLDEST ON THE 4TH OF JULY

IF IT WEREN'T FOR FB ARGUMENTS
I WOULD HAVE TO DO PRODUCTIVE THINGS

WHY IS MY DOG MOLTING SO MUCH
IT'S JUST NOT FUR

IF YOU ARE JUST NOTICING THE CORRUPTION OF THE ELECTION SYSTEM BECAUSE YOUR CANDIDATE LOST, WAKE UP! THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN RIGGED FOR A LONG TIME
MAYBE NOW THAT IT HAS YOUR ATTENTION, YOU WILL BEGIN TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT REFORMING IT

HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOUR TEACHER
TELLS YOU THAT STATE TESTING IS COMMING UP

MY HUSBAND SAID THE GOVERNMENT WAS SPYING ON US

IS TO GET SOCCER BALLS WHEN THEY FALL UNDER THE CAR

I JUST REALIZED THAT I HAVE BEEN

LOYALTY IS VALUABLE
DON'T EXPECT IT FROM SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T KNOW YOUR VALUE

WHEN THEY SAID BECOME A BETTER PERSON

A WEEK LATER THEY COME OUT WITH THE IPHONE 282393S

WHEN YOU LIVE IN ALABAMA
BUT BELONG IN NEW YORK CITY

CAN'T USE THE LADIES' ROOM IN PUBLIC
AM AFRAID THERE MAY BE A TRANNY IN THERE

VACATION WAS SO LONG
THE DVR FILLED UP AND STOPPED RECORDING

WHEN YOU WORK PART TIME FOR TWO YEARS AND SAVE $8000
ONLY TO HAVE IT ALL GONE WHEN THE FIRST COLLEGE PAYMENT COMES

CLICK BAIT ADS ON IMGFLIP ARE SHOWING THESE INSANELY HUGE CHEESEBURGERS
I REALLY WANT ONE, BUT I'M IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW

MY LIFE IS SO DULL
I CAN ONLY TELL WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IT IS BECAUSE OF TACO TUESDAY

WHEN YOU REALIZE
YOU FORGOT TO STUDY FOR THE FSA TEST

COMES INTO WORK DRESSED AS KATY PERRY FOR HALLOWEEN
GETS FIRED FOR VIOLATING THE DRESS CODE

ADULTING IS HARD
CAN'T SOMEONE JUST ADOPT ME

TRIED TO JUMP
GAME GLITCHED

JUST A PIECE OF DUST
UNDER MY SCREEN PROTECTOR

THE LIST OF POLITICALLY CORRECT
HALLOWEEN COSTUMES KEEPS GETTING SHORTER

People who have it better than me have problems
that get more attention than mine.

I CANT WAIT
FOR "ONE PUNCH MAN" SEASON 2

HAVEN'T HAD GOOD IDEAS FOR MEMES
IN TOO LONG

WHEN YOU DON'T GET TO SEE
JEFFREY MEMES ANYMORE

MY COMPUTER RESTARTED AUTOMATICALLY
TO INSTALL WINDOWS 10

WHEN YOU

I DISCOVERED A SALE FOR A ITEM I REALLY WANTED
THE DAY AFTER IT ENDED

I HAVE THE WORST MOM
SHE TURNED OFF THE WIFI

TOO LAZY TO MAKE TWO JOURNEYS STRUGGLING TO CARRY, TEA, TOAST, CEREAL
FORGET SPOON!

WHY LIFE DID
U DO THIS TO ME WHYYYYYYYYYY

HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
THINK ABOUT MY THINKING?!?

THE BILL WAS $51 AND THEY ONLY HANDED ME $50, BUT I THOUGHT THEY GAVE ME $60
NOT ONLY WAS I SHORTHANDED, BUT I GAVE THEM BACK CHANGE AS WELL

WHY CAN'T THEY SEE WE RE NOT ANTI MUSLIM
JUST ANTI ISLAM

I PUT A BLANKET OUT TO SAVE MY SPOT FOR THE PARADE

WHEN YOU GO TO CHURCH

THEN I FOUND OUT THAT OVER 200 OF MY STEAM GAMES ARE FOR MAC TOO

WHEN FRENDS SUPORT TUMP
AND YOU SUPURT HILERY

I JUST WANTED TO SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY
THEN I GOT SUED

WANTS TO BE A MEME LORD
CAN'T COME UP WITH A GOOD MEME

SEATS ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE ICE
CAN'T PROPERLY SEE THE PREGAME LIGHTSHOW

NOT ONE TRICK OR TREATER
WHAT A LOUSY DAY TO START MY DIET.

WHEN PEOPLE TRY SO HARD TO MAKE A GOOD MEME
AND IT DOSE NOT MAKE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE

IT SEEMS THAT GOD USES THOSE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE FLAMES OF HELL
TO GO BACK AND POUR WATER ON THE ONES STILL IN THE FIRE.

WHEN YOU GOOGLE SOMETHING

THAT MOMENT
WHEN YOUR MOM SAT ON YOUR IPHONE

WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND A PARKING SPOT AFTER 15 MINUTES

I HAVE TO PLAY LASER TAG FOR WORK AGAIN
ALL THE FREE ICE CREAM GIVES ME CRAMPS

WHEN YOUR MEME HAS
1 VIEW

IT'S HARD TO GET THE FIRST COUPLE OF THEM OUT

STAY IN A 2 STORY SUITE WITH VAULTED CEILING AND LARGE PICTURE WINDOWS OVERLOOKING THE BAY
SUN LIGHTS UP THE WHOLE PLACE BY 4:45 AM

IF YOU SEW THE SIDES AND ADD SOME AIR
MY NEW BATHING SUIT COULD BE USED AS A REFUGEE RAFT

Christmas party ran out of napkins
They used toilet seat liners

A cold front is coming to Phoenix
I might have to wear long pants

I CAPITALIZE AND LOWER CASE MY MEME TEXTS
THEN I REMEMBER THE ALL CAPS OPTION IS SELECTED

KenJ made the top 100
And didn't even say thank you

IF EVERYONE PICKED UP AFTER THEMSELVES THERE WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH HOUSEWORK
WHY DON'T THE CATS AND DOGS UNDERSTAND THIS

THE WIFI WONT REACH MY BEDROOM

HE SENT THEM BACK

MY MEETING'S ON THE 10TH FLOOR
I'LL WAIT FOR A SAFE RIDE.

I COOKED ALL THE DAY
AND NOW I HAVE A STRANGE TASTE IN MY MOUTH

ONE OF THE MAIN FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS
IS NOT HAVING A GOOD MEME

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU DISCOVER THAT THE DO NOT CALL LIST IS A JOKE

WHEN YOUR FAVORITE SONG
DOESN'T HAVE SHEET MUSIC

MY BILLIONAIRE PARENTS TOLD
ME I WAS ADOPTED

I'VE NEVER BEEN
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

OUR THOA (TRAILER HOME OWNER'S ASSN.) IMPOSED A $20/YR ANNUAL FEE

WHEN ITS NSFW FILTH WEEK, SQUIRREL WEEK, GOOD LUCK BRIAN WEEK AND LIMERICK WEEK AT THE SAME TIME
BUT STILL NOT FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS WEEK

CHRISTMAS IS OVER
NOW I HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR MY SHOPPING HABIT

THE BANK PUT MY CHECK ON HOLD
FOR A FULL DAY

A baseball and football game on the same night
I don't know which one to watch

WHY IS IT THAT THINGS ARE LOVED AND PEOPLE USED
WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE OTHER WAY ROUND?

JUST REMEMBER PEOPLE WHO
MAKES MEMES HAS FEELINGS

WHEN I KILL SANS
I BE LIKE

IT'S TOUGH BEING
RIGHT ALL THE TIME

<SNIFF> I COULDN'T NEGOTIATE AS HIGH OF A SALARY AS MY MALE COLLEAGUES
MAYBE I SHOULD UNION INSTEAD OF MANAGEMENT

I WISH
SUGAR WAS HEALTHY

I FORGOT TO UPVOTE MY
MEMER

WHEN YOU WAKE UP
2 MINUTES BEFORE THE ALARM GOES OFF

THEY ASK HOW YOU AND YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU'RE FINE
BUT YOURE NOT REALLY FINE

THE MOMENT YOU REMEMBER
YOUR OTP ISN'T CANON

MOVING MOM FROM INDEPENDENT TO ASSISTED LIVING
NOT AN EASY THING TO DO

My
Smart-phone changes "lol" to "LOL"
making me sound more amused than I actually am!

I REBOOTED MY COMPUTER
AND HAD TO REPOSITION EVERY APP WINDOW

THAT MOMENT IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU WERE BETTER OFF JUST KEEPING A BOY TOY.

I GOT A VENTI FRAPACCINO AT STARBUCKS
BUT THEY WERE OUT OF THE LONG STRAWS

When you have one submission left
And you've run out of ideas

TOO OLD FOR SNAPCHAT
TOO YOUNG FOR LIFE ALERT

HE SAID THAT IF I CAN'T HANDLE THE HEAT TO GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN
BUT MAKE HIM A SANDWICH FIRST

EVERYONE'S GRAMMAR IS MORE SOPHISTICATED
THEN MINE.

WE RAN OUT OF
CHEERIOS

WHEN YOU FIND OUT PICKLES ARE
CUCUMBERS

I VOTED FOR TRUMP
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO BAN ANKLE-LENGTH PANTS AND DEPORT CULOTTES TO MEXICO.

BE THE BIGGER PERSON
ME: I CAN'T I AM ONLY 5' 3

WANTS TO READ THE HELPFUL TIPS BETWEEN LOADING SCREENS
GAME LOADS TOO QUICKLY ON THE SSD TO READ THEM

WHEN YOU STEAL YOUR KIDS CHICKEN NUGGET FROM MCDONALDS
AND YOU GET OLD MEMORIES

MY COMPUTER'S DEAD
LOOKS LIKE I CAN'T GO TO THE BATHROOM NOW

MY GEEK SQUAD GUY
GHOSTED ME

WHEN YOU REALIZE
YOUR PHONE IS STILL IN THE BATHROOM

HE SPRAYED HIS COLON ON ME
AND THATS ALL I CAN SMELL

THE STARBUCKS CASHIER TOLD ME "HAVE A GOOD DAY, MISS."
HE ASSUMED MY GENDER!

I ONCE DATED A PUPPETEER
IT WAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED

I'M HAVING A BAD DAY, AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW FRIENDLY THE INTERNET CAN BE
GIVE ME YOUR BEST MEMES TO CHEER ME UP?

I CAN'T TAKE MY VACATION
AT AREA 51

THIS GAME KEEPS GIVING ME STUFF
SELLING THE CRATES THAT I DON'T WANT IS JUST TOO HARD

TRUMP SAID RACISM IS UNAMERICAN
BUT HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ONLY WHITES ARE RACIST

WHEN SOMEONE PLAYS TORB
ON ATTACK

PLAYING ONLINE
BABY SISTER TURNS CONSOLE OFF

ONLY 3 OUT OF 5 DENTISTS RECOMMENDED
MY NEW TOOTHPASTE.

I SIT IN CAR TRAFFIC GOING TO WORK
THEN I SIT IN FORKLIFT TRAFFIC AT WORK

I LOOK UP FUNNY PICS FOR MY MEMES TO USE ORGINAL TEMPLATES
AND ALL I GET ARE JUST MEMES

GOT 9,999,999 TEARS TO GO
AND THEN I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE OVER YOU

HE CAUGHT ME CHEATING
IT'S HIS FAULT FOR SPYING ON ME

SET THE TURKEY IN THE REFRIGERATOR 2 DAYS AGO
IT'S STILL FROZEN

I THINK YOU NEED TO STUDY THE 7 LEVELS OF GRIEF
AND THEN LOOK AT YOUR FACEBOOK POSTS
AND TWEETS

THE LOOK ON LIBERALS FACE WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO RELOCATE TO CANADA BECAUSE TRUMP WAS ELECTED AND REALIZE
THEY NEED TO HAVE A JOB, THEY DON'T ALLOW ILLEGALS, AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HOCKEY...

MY APPETITE FOR AND LOVE OF POMEGRANATES HAS RETURNED
BUT NOW ALL OUR POMEGRANATES ARE OLD, ROTTEN, AND MOLDY

MY BONNIE TYLER SATNAV
KEEPS TELLING ME TO TURN AROUND

NO JOB FOR 8 MONTHS
AND FINALLY GETTING ONE

I BOUGHT TOO MUCH PIZZA
AND I DONT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN MY FRIDGE TO KEEP IT

WHEN YOU CAN'T THINK OF A MEME
AND JUST POST THIS

THE LIST OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS I NEED TO WATCH
KEEPS GETTING LONGER AND LONGER!

EVERYONE WILL BE TOO BUSY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE ELECTION
TO CELEBRATE THE GREATEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED - ME!

NEW USERS ARE GETTING TO 70K+ POINTS AFTER BEING ON THE SITE FOR 10 DAYS
WHILE I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 5 MONTHS AND HAVE ONLY 50K

I GOT A FREE BIRTHDAY DRINK FROM STARBUCKS
I DON'T GET TO ENJOY IT, AS I ALREADY GET FREE DRINKS ALMOST EVERY DAY...

RAYDOG CAN SUBMIT A BLANK MEME
AND STILL GET MORE VIEWS THAN ME

IT'S HARD WORK
TAKING OFF ALL MY JEWELLERY

WHEN YOU GET RAISING CANE'S
AND THEY FORGOT THE CANE SAUCE

OFFICE TOO COLD WITH SPACE HEATER OFF
OFFICE TOO HOT WITH SPACE HEATER ON

I WANT PEOPLE TO COMMENT ON THIS MEME
JUST SO I GET NOTIFICATIONS

MY MEME GOT A LOT OF COMMENTS
BUT VERY FEW UPVOTES

I wanted to lose 10 ponds by Chritmas
Only 13 pounds to go

WHEN THE MEME WAS FUNNY
BUT ALSO TOUCHES YOUR DEEPEST INSECURITIES

MY NEIGHBOR PUT A PASSWORD
ON HIS WIFI

ONE OF MY FACEBOOK FRIENDS
UNFOLLOWED ME

TRIED TO SUCK MY WAY TO THE TOP
HAD TO ASSUME GENDER

I HATE IT WHEN I CAN'T
RE"MEME"BER GOOD IDEAS

WHEN YOU TAKE A BIG GULP OF WATER
AND IT‚ÄôS ACTUALLY SELTZER

I ONCE ATE PART OF A FRIDGE MAGNET
I THOUGHT IT WAS MADE OF ICING

I FORGOT MY PHONE
AT THE STORE IN A PAIR OF SHOES

I WAS ON VACATION FOR A WEEK WITH NO CNN
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO BE OUTRAGED ABOUT THIS WEEK

I HATE THE ALT-RIGHT
BUT I LOVE PEPE THE FROG

DOOR OV TE LAAT KOMEN
EN OP HET SUMMA COLLEGE ZITTEN

THE SHOES I LIKE ARE SOLD OUT
LIFE IS TERRIBLE

LAW THAT DEEMS BIRTH CONTROL INFO OBSCENE AND OUTLAWS ITS DISSEMINATION. AT THE TIME, THE U.S. IS THE ONLY WESTERN NATION TO CRIMINALIZE CONTRACEPTION
USA'S 1800-1900+ LAW- WOMEN HAVING TOO MANY BABIES, WOMEN DYING, CAN'T AFFORD THIS MANY CHILDREN. CONSERVATIVES, SO, YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS. WILL YOU TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THESE CHILDREN IF YOU DENY WOMEN THEIR RIGHTS?

WHY ARE THERE MEN
STILL ACTING AS CHILDREN?

Wanted Purple Caption

WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE STARVING
AND THERE‚ÄôS NOTHING TO EAT IN THE FRIDGE BECAUSE YOU DIDN‚ÄôT GO SHOPPING

LAST DAY I GET THE ELF TO HELP ME

BUT REALLY, WHY WOULD I WANT TO?

EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW HOT IT IS
I JUST WANT 2 FEET OF SNOW

TRUMP WON
NOW I'VE GOT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY

MY PHONE IS AT ONE PERCENT
AND THE CHARGER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN
YOU HAVE A GREAT MEME IDEA AND YOU JUST SUDDENLY FORGET IT

WHEN YOUR PHONE DECIDES
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SHUT DOWN FOR NO REASON

DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN YOU'RE LIKE "MY HOMEWORK WAS DESTROYED WHEN MY HOUSE BURNT DOWN"
AND YOUR TEACHERS LIKE "WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT IT IN A SAFER PLACE, YOU'RE STILL FAILING"

WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR BIRTHDAY
TWO DAYS BEFORE VALENTINES DAY

WHEN SOMEONE LAUGHS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE BRACES AND THEY HAVE PERFECT TEETH
AND YOUR GUMS ARE TOO SORE FOR YOU TO EVEN EAT DORITOS

SOMEBODY PUT THE EMPTY MILK CARTON
BACK IN THE FRIDGE

MY 85 INCH TV WON'T FIT ON MY 70 INCH STAND
FIRST WORLD PROBELMS, AM I RIGHT

I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A COMMENT
SINCE LAST YEAR

WHEN YOU HAVEN'T MEMED IN A WHILE
AND YOU'RE AFRAID THAT YOUR SQUAD HAS GIVEN UP ON YOU

BUT SOCIETY WON'T ALLOW ME TO DENY IT EITHER

I GOT SO CAUGHT UP IN REAL LIFE AND DEBATING RL ISSUES ONLINE
I FORGOT TO USE MY THREE SUBMISSIONS..

I WENT BOXING DAY SHOPPING
AND THERE WAS ONLY SHIT ELECTRONICS FOR SALE

I ACT GIRLY INFRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE
BECAUSE IF I DON'T THEY THINK IM EVIL

When you

WHEN YOUR MEME ENDS UP ON
R/COMEDYCEMETERY

JUST SPENT $300 ON BTS SNEAKERS
NOW THEY TELL ME THEY NEED CLEATS

TRYING TO GO TO A PARTY
WAITED AT A STOP SIGN FOR AN HOUR

THEY ASK YOU HOW YOU ARE AND YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU'RE FINE
AND YOUR NOT REALLY FINE BUT YOU CANT GET INTO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND

WHEN YOU SPEND WEEKS ON IMGFLIP THINKING UP MEME IDEAS
AND NOBODY UPVOTES IT

ME REALISING I NEED TO DIET NEXT YEAR
HOW WILL I LIVE WITHOUT CONSTANT SNACKING?

SO MANY ASSHOLES
AND NOT ENOUGH ARMOR PIERCING RADIATED ROUNDS

WHEN IMGFLIP ADMINS
DON'T FEATURE YOUR EDGY MEME

FOR 10 HOURS I DRIVED AROUND TRYING TO FIND MY CAR
WHILE DRIVING IN MY CAR

I TRADED MY IPHONE FOR A WINDOWS PLATFORM
NOW EVERYONE WANTS TO BORROW IT ALL THE TIME

25 VIEWS AND NO UPVOTES
ON SOMETHING I THOUGHT SO CLEVER

I TOLD MY FRIEND I WAS TIRED OF ALL THE GIFS

THE PROBLEM WITH HOMESCHOOLING
WAS WHEN I TRIED TO GO SHOPPING IN THE AFTERNOON, THE CASHIER ALWAYS ASKED "IS SCHOOL OUT TODAY, YOUNG MAN?

MY HISTORY TEACHER WAS A 65-YEAR-OLD MAN THAT YELLED AT MY CRUSH TOO MUCH
I CRI EVRYTIEM

WHEN YOU HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING
ANY NOTIFICATIONS ON IMGFLIP FOR DAYS

ALL I WANT TO DO
IS EAT MY PANCAKES

I CAN'T MAKE IT IN ON TIME TUESDAY
THE BACHELOR IS STILL ON AND WINE WAS INVOLVED

WHEN YOU FINALLY REALIZED
TRUMP BECAME PRESIDENT

ME WHEN I HAVE SO MANY VIEWS ON A MEME
AND I SEE THERE'S A TYPO IN IT

YOU CAN TELL YOUR SAD
WHEN YOU RANDOMLY COMMENT ON MEMES FOR POINTS

I asked if I could be sun of his life

IF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION REALLY DOES RANK HIGHER THAN THE RED CROSS IN ACCOUNTABILITY
THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE DONATING TO THE RED CROSS

WATER FROM MY IN-DOOR DISPENSER DOESN'T START GETTING COLD
UNTIL THE GLASS IS FULL

I HAVE TO POOP
BUT THE MAIDS ARE CLEANING MY BATHROOM

THOUGHT I LOST MY FITBIT
FOUND IT AFTER BUYING APPLE WATCH

WHY
DID BATMAN SAVE ME

HOW DO I WATCH BLACK PANTHER
IF I‚ÄôM RACIST AS HECK

THE MOMENT YOU RELIZE
YOU LOST YOUR AIRPODS

I HELD MY HAND UNDER THE DISPENSER WAITING FOR SOAP
IT'S NOT MOTION ACTIVATED

I don't understand politics, support progressive candidates or parties, but I identify as progressive damn it & don't want to learn differently. How dare Greens bring up other political worldviews inadvertently exsposing that I don't even understand the one I blindly support. All I really want is a circle jerk about how "progressive" I am for supporting the Dem party
I don't want to discuss or understand the topics I bring up, I just want my taco licked for being a good sheep

Grief - It's a personal thing
The moment you realize you're getting older - from child to teen, from teen to young adult, young adult to mid-life, from mid-life to maturity, from maturity to death, you grieve. Whenever there's transition there is grief. And it is the strength of the grief that will usher you in to the next level of your own conscious evolution. Hide, deny, indulge or manipulate it will result in a stunting of that growth. Stand with it and stay with it. Let it go when you no longer need it.
